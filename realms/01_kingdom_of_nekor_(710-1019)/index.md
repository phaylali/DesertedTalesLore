# Kingdom of Nekor

## Summary

The Kingdom of Nekor (also known as the Salihid Emirate) was a medieval Islamic kingdom located in the Rif area of present-day Morocco. It was founded in 710 CE by Salih I ibn Mansur, an Arab from Himyar. The kingdom was the first autonomous state in the Maghreb to exclusively adhere to Sunni Islam. The capital was initially Temsaman, but later moved to Nekor. The Banu Salih dynasty ruled the region until 1019 CE when it was conquered by the Azdâji emir Ya'la ibn Futuh.
