# Salih I

Salih I was the founder of the Kingdom of Nekor. In 712, the local Berber tribes, finding the restrictions of Islam too difficult, deposed him and installed Dawud al-Rundi al-Nafzi. However, after a few months, they were dissatisfied with the new ruler and reinstated Salih I, who then ruled until his death in 749.
