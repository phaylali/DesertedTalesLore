## Notes

Salih I was the founder of the Kingdom of Nekor. In 712, the local Berber tribes, finding the restrictions of Islam too difficult, deposed him and installed Dawud al-Rundi al-Nafzi. However, after a few months, they were dissatisfied with the new ruler and reinstated Salih I, who then ruled until his death in 749. capital was temsaman.

Jurthum ibn Ahmad Adopted the Maliki school of Islamic law and was the last ruler of the dynasty before its end in 1019 CE.
A long-distance Viking expedition entered the Mediterranean and launched a major raid on Nekor in 859 CE. The Viking fleet, reportedly 62 ships strong, defeated a local force and plundered the city, taking many inhabitants as slaves. Some of these captives were later ransomed by the Umayyad Caliph at Córdoba. This event demonstrates that the Emirate of Nekor, despite its small size, was not an isolated entity but was deeply integrated into the wider Mediterranean world. The Viking raid highlights its vulnerability as a coastal state and confirms its strategic importance to the larger Islamic powers, whose involvement in ransoming captives further solidifies the vassal relationship.
