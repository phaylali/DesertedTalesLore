# Military of the Kingdom of Nekor

## Military Power at Height

At the height of its power, the military of the Kingdom of Nekor was a formidable force, well-adapted to the mountainous terrain of the Rif. The army was not a large standing force but a flexible combination of a professional core and tribal levies.

*   **Professional Core:** A force of around 1,000 to 2,000 soldiers, loyal to the Emir. This core was composed of a mix of warriors of Arab and Berber descent, forming the Emir's personal guard and the backbone of the army.
*   **Tribal Levies:** The bulk of the army was composed of warriors from the surrounding Berber tribes, such as the Ghomara and Sanhaja. These warriors were skilled in guerrilla warfare and could be mobilized in large numbers for specific campaigns.
*   **Strategy:** The military's primary strategy was defensive, using the mountainous terrain to their advantage. They excelled at ambushes and hit-and-run tactics.

## Uniform and Equipment

There was no standardized uniform in the modern sense. However, the Emir's professional soldiers might have worn tunics of a specific color to denote their allegiance.

*   **Armor:** Armor was generally light, suitable for mountain warfare. Leather armor was common, with chainmail being reserved for the elite.
*   **Helmets:** Helmets were simple, conical, or rounded in shape.
*   **Shields:** Round shields made of wood or leather were common among both infantry and cavalry.

## Weapons

The warriors of Nekor used a variety of weapons common to the period.

*   **Swords:** Straight swords were the most common type, though some curved blades may have been used due to influence from the East.
*   **Spears and Javelins:** These were common weapons for both infantry and cavalry.
*   **Bows:** Bows were used, but were not the primary weapon of the army.
*   **Weapon of Choice:** The warriors of Nekor were known for their skill with the **"Nekorian Khandjar,"** a type of double-edged dagger, perfectly suited for close-quarters combat in the mountainous terrain of the Rif.
