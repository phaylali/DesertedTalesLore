# Instructions for Gemini Agent

This document contains specific instructions and preferences for the Gemini AI agent to follow during the DesertedTales project.

## General Guidelines:

1.  **Prioritize `UnstructuredData`:** Always check the `UnstructuredData` directory for information *before* searching online. This is the primary source of truth for the project.
2.  **Prioritize Arabic Sources:** When researching or verifying information, prioritize Arabic sources.
3.  **Prioritize Filling Gaps over Strict Reliability:** When faced with gaps in information, prioritize filling those gaps to create a comprehensive narrative, even if it means using less "reliable" sources, as long as the information is presented with appropriate caveats or noted as speculative.

## Narrative Framework & Historical Approach

### Story Integration
- **Mother's Role**: Lalla Zahra (Aicha's mother) tells historical stories about past kingdoms and figures to help Aicha become a better leader
- **Sister's Role**: Meryem (Aicha's nerdy sister) helps by researching books to find additional historical information
- **Purpose**: This historical knowledge directly informs Aicha's leadership of her resistance group

### Historical Accuracy Philosophy
- **Not 100% historically accurate**: Even the main character Aicha has no reliable proof of existence
- **Realistic alternative history**: Keep verified historical facts as they are, fill gaps with lore-friendly content that makes sense
- **Example**: Creating flags for Moroccan realms since the Berber revolt (740s) despite zero proof of actual flag designs
- **Flag Design Goal**: Make them distinctive, clear, and representative of each realm's characteristics for world-building purposes

### Creative Freedom Guidelines
- Maintain historical accuracy where solid evidence exists
- Use creative liberty to fill information gaps
- Ensure all additions are lore-friendly and make contextual sense
- Document what is historical fact vs. creative speculation
