## Biography
Ali ibn Yusuf was the fifth Almoravid emir, ruling from 1106 to 1143. Born around 1084 in Ceuta, he was the son of Yusuf ibn Tashfin and possibly Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyah or a Christian concubine named Qamar.

Succeeding his father in 1106 at age 23, Ali appointed his brother Tamim governor of Al-Andalus. He expanded Almoravid control by capturing Zaragoza in 1110, reaching the empire's peak in the Iberian Peninsula. Almoravid forces besieged Toledo (1114), Barcelona (1115), and Coimbra (1117), but failed to capture them.

From 1118–1120, Alfonso I of Aragon recaptured Zaragoza and surrounding areas. Córdoba rebelled briefly in 1121. The 1120s–1130s saw bitter struggles with Alfonso, with losses like Zorita and Siguenza, while the frontier with Castile and Portugal stabilized.

Ali faced the rising Almohad threat under Ibn Tumart in Morocco, recalling troops from Al-Andalus. His son Tashfin, governor of Granada and Almeria, led victories like Aceca (1130), Fraga (1134), and Badajoz (1134), but suffered losses like Oreja (1139) and Coria (1142) due to Almohad pressures.

Ali commissioned the Minbar of the Kutubiyya Mosque and fortified Marrakesh with walls. He died in 1143, succeeded by Tashfin ibn Ali, as Almoravid decline accelerated.

## Skills and Abilities
Ali excelled in military strategy and administration, expanding the empire and defending against Christian advances. He patronized architecture and fortifications, demonstrating political acumen in managing diverse territories.
