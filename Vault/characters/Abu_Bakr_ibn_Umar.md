## Biography
Abu Bakr ibn Umar was a Lamtuna Berber chieftain and emir of the Almoravids from 1056 to 1087. He succeeded his brother Yahya ibn Umar after his death in battle, becoming the primary military leader of the movement founded by Abdallah ibn Yasin.

In 1056, Abu Bakr recaptured Sijilmasa from the Maghrawa, securing the southern trade routes. He then conquered the Sous valley, taking Taroudannt, and allied with the Masmuda Berbers to seize Aghmat in 1058. After ibn Yasin's death at the hands of the Barghawata, Abu Bakr launched a brutal campaign, destroying the heretical Barghawata state and converting survivors to orthodox Islam.

Disliking urban life, Abu Bakr established Marrakesh in 1060–1061 as a desert-like encampment, becoming its co-founder. He married Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyah, Aghmat's wealthiest woman, for political support. In the 1060s, he entrusted northern campaigns to Yusuf ibn Tashfin, who conquered Fez in 1070.

In 1071, Abu Bakr returned to the Sahara to quell tribal dissent, leaving Yusuf in charge of Morocco. Upon returning in 1072, he ceded northern rule to Yusuf after negotiations, retaining command of the southern Almoravids. He raided pagan Sudan, possibly attacking Ghana, though this is disputed.

Abu Bakr died in 1087 from a poisoned arrow in Tagant, Mauritania, during a campaign. His legacy includes founding Marrakesh and expanding Almoravid territory, though he preferred desert life over governance.

## Skills and Abilities
Abu Bakr excelled in military strategy, leading conquests across Morocco and enforcing Maliki orthodoxy. He was a pragmatic leader, balancing tribal alliances and urban politics, and demonstrated resilience in desert warfare.
