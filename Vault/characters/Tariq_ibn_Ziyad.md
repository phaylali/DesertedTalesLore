## Biography
Tariq ibn Ziyad was a Berber military commander who played a pivotal role in the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. Born in North Africa around 670-680 CE, he was of Nafzi Berber origin (possibly from the Ulhassa tribe), from the same region and tribe as Salih ibn Mansur, the founder of the Emirate of Nekor. As a client (mawla) of the Umayyad governor Musa ibn Nusayr, Tariq was appointed governor of Tangier and was instrumental in the conquest of North Africa. He supported the establishment of the Emirate of Nekor in 710 CE to secure the cooperation of local Berber tribes, particularly the Nafza and Ghomara, who had knowledge of the Iberian Peninsula, paving the way for the invasion of Spain.

The invasion was facilitated by Julian, Count of Ceuta, who, angered by the alleged rape of his daughter Florinda by Visigothic king Roderic, provided ships and support. In 711 CE, Tariq led an army of about 7,000 soldiers (mostly Berbers with some Arabs) across the Strait of Gibraltar, landing at the Rock of Gibraltar (named after him as Jabal Tariq). According to legend, he ordered the ships burned to prevent retreat. He defeated Roderic at the Battle of Guadalete on July 19, 711, leading to the rapid conquest of most of the Iberian Peninsula. His forces captured key cities like Cordoba, Granada, and Toledo, advancing north to Guadalajara, Astorga, and beyond. Tariq served as de facto governor of Al-Andalus until Musa's arrival in 712.

After the conquest, Tariq was recalled to Damascus by Caliph Al-Walid I and reportedly died around 720 CE in obscurity. His legacy as the conqueror of Spain endures, symbolizing the Berber contribution to early Islamic expansions. He is also remembered for a famous motivational speech to his troops before the Battle of Guadalete.

## Skills and Abilities
Tariq was a skilled military strategist, adept at leading diverse armies, exploiting local alliances, and executing amphibious invasions. His ability to mobilize Berber tribes, integrate Berber and Arab troops, and conduct rapid conquests demonstrated exceptional leadership and tactical acumen in asymmetric warfare. He is noted for his decisive victory at Guadalete and the swift capture of major cities.
