## Biography
Yusuf ibn Tashfin was a Berber leader and the founder of the Almoravid dynasty, which unified much of North Africa and Islamic Spain. Born around 1009 in the Sahara Desert, he was a member of the Lamtuna tribe, part of the Sanhaja confederation. He rose to prominence under Abu Bakr ibn Umar, the spiritual leader of the Almoravids, who entrusted him with governance of northern territories, including the Sous region.

In 1061, Yusuf succeeded Abu Bakr as emir, taking the title Amir al-Muslimin (Commander of the Muslims) while acknowledging the Abbasid caliph's suzerainty. He expanded the empire northward, conquering Fez in 1075, Tangier, and other cities, reaching the Mediterranean. He co-founded Marrakesh in 1062 as the new capital, shifting power from Aghmat.

Invited by the taifa kings of Al-Andalus to counter Christian advances, Yusuf crossed the Strait of Gibraltar in 1086. He decisively defeated Alfonso VI of Castile at the Battle of Sagrajas (az-Zallaqah), halting the Reconquista for decades. Returning in 1090, he deposed the taifa rulers, annexing most of Al-Andalus except Zaragoza, uniting the Maghreb and Islamic Spain under Almoravid rule.

Yusuf's campaigns included sieges like Valencia, where he conquered the city after El Cid's death. He established a professional army with Berber, Sudanese, and Christian mercenaries, and promoted Maliki orthodoxy. He died in Marrakesh in 1106, succeeded by his son Ali ibn Yusuf. His empire marked the peak of Almoravid power, fostering cultural and architectural developments.

## Skills and Abilities
Yusuf was a masterful military strategist, adept at organizing diverse armies and executing large-scale conquests. He excelled in state-building, founding Marrakesh and unifying fragmented territories.
