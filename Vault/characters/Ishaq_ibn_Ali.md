## Biography
Ishaq ibn Ali was the brother of Tashfin ibn Ali and uncle to Ibrahim ibn Tashfin. After Tashfin's death in 1145, Ibrahim, aged 14, briefly succeeded but faced opposition. Ishaq refused Ibrahim's rule, leading to internal conflict in Marrakesh as the Almohads besieged the city.

In 1147, Ishaq became the last Almoravid emir. Facing relentless Almohad attacks led by Abd al-Mu'min, he fled to the Atlas Mountains for refuge. After a brief respite, he returned to Marrakesh to reclaim control, but the Almohads captured the city in Shawwal 541 AH (March 1147). Both Ibrahim and Ishaq were killed in the brutal massacre that followed, marking the end of the Almoravid dynasty and the establishment of the Almohad Caliphate.

## Skills and Abilities
