## Biography
Tashfin ibn Ali was the son of Ali ibn Yusuf, the fifth Almoravid emir. He served as governor of Granada and Almería from 1129, and Córdoba from 1131. As supreme governor of Al-Andalus from 1126 to 1137, he led the Almoravids to several victories against Christian forces, including the captures of Aceca (1130), Fraga (1134), Badajoz (1134), and Escalona (1137). However, after his departure to Morocco in 1138, the tide turned, with losses at Oreja (1139) and Coria (1142) due to Almohad advances.

Upon his father's death in 1143, Tashfin succeeded as emir. Facing the rising Almohad threat, he confronted them in the Oran region in 1145. Besieged by Abd al-Mu'min's forces, he attempted to escape by sea, calling for a fleet from Almería. He burned his encampment and tried to reach the port on horseback at night, but fell off a cliff in the Atlas Mountains and died in March 1145.

He was briefly succeeded by his infant son Ibrahim ibn Tashfin, then by his brother Ishaq ibn Ali.

## Skills and Abilities
Tashfin was a capable military commander, achieving notable victories in Al-Andalus against Christian kingdoms. He demonstrated strategic acumen in governance and warfare, though his reign was marked by the challenges of internal decline and external threats from the Almohads.
