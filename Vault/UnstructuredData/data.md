Sayyida al-Hurra was a largely forgotten **sixteenth-century North African queen and military leader** who ruled the city of Tétouan for over three decades, from approximately 1510 to 1542 CE. She was of Andalusi descent and her titles, Sayyida and Hurra, signified "master" or "leader" and indicated freedom and independence, respectively. During her reign, Morocco faced significant challenges including political fragmentation and attacks from Portuguese and Spanish forces. Al-Hurra emerged as a well-trained and respected governor who employed conventional warfare, piracy, political marriages, and alliances with the Ottomans to defend her people and northern Morocco. This study, addressing a lack of information on al-Hurra especially in English, used a historical and ethnographic approach, drawing data from Arabic secondary literature, interviews with local Moroccan historians, and visits to historical sites. The Arabic materials, often unavailable in English, provided insights into her biography, family, influence, and the history of Tétouan and Chefchaouen. Interviews were conducted with prominent historians Ali Risouni and Fatima Bouchmal, as well as Mohammed ben Saaid, who managed a museum related to her father's qasbah.

Northern Morocco, with its strategic location and resources, was a frequent target for foreign powers. The first half of the sixteenth century was a turbulent period that shaped modern Morocco, marked by the fall of the Wattasid ruling family, the rise of the Saadi rulers, and Spanish and Portuguese assaults along the coast. The Portuguese, for instance, occupied Moroccan cities like Tangier, Asilah, and Ksar es-Seghir in 1471\. Amidst this upheaval, al-Hurra was born around 1495 CE in Chefchaouen, a rich intellectual and political environment. Her father, Moulay Ali ben Rashid, born around 1440, was a sharif, meaning he traced his ancestry to the Prophet Muhammed. He founded Chefchaouen in 1471 to defend Morocco against the Portuguese, after moving to Granada in 1460 to learn military skills. After the fall of Granada, he returned as a "prince of war" and built a qasbah (fortress) in a mountainous area, away from coastal attacks, which is now a museum.

Al-Hurra's respected lineage and family's political authority were instrumental in her acquiring leadership and cultural skills. She received a strong education from prominent scholars, including instruction in law, religion, and Arabic, and was fluent in Spanish and Portuguese. Her education also extended to military matters, allowing her to forge a clear vision for her people's future.

Her rise to power began with her first marriage in 1510 to Moulay Ali Al-Mandri, the governor of Tétouan. This marriage aimed to strengthen ties between the two main ruling families in the North and secure an ally against the Portuguese. During her husband's frequent absences due to warfare, al-Hurra was left in charge and managed city affairs, gaining experience in statecraft and naval skills, which were vital given the Al-Mandri family's naval power. After Al-Mandri's death in 1519, her brother, Moulay Ibrahim ben Rashid, appointed her as the **governor of Tétouan**, a position the people accepted due to her proven competence.

For three decades, al-Hurra governed from her qasbah, which served as the center of her government, housing the treasury and prison. She supervised military operations and made major decisions with the help of advisers, including her brother, Ibrahim ben Rashid. Al-Hurra established distinct policies, notably **collaborating with the Ottoman corsair Barbarossa**, allowing his ships to use Moroccan ports and strengthening an alliance against the Iberian threat. This also opened markets for goods acquired through piracy, boosting the economy.

Al-Hurra was celebrated in Morocco as a **hero, a "princess of jihad,"** who defended the North from foreign threats. In Europe, however, she was often labeled a **"pirate queen"**. Muslim countries viewed piracy as a legitimate response to the forced expulsion of Andalusi Muslims by the Spanish, seeing it as a religious obligation to protect Muslim lands, while European countries held a less positive view. She expanded the fleet she inherited, building shipyards and increasing vessels and sailors. Her fleet operated freely in the western Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic, posing a significant threat to Iberian trade and occupation. Her forces engaged in both defensive and offensive campaigns, attacking European ships and cities, taking cargo and thousands of prisoners, which generated revenue through ransom or sale into slavery. For instance, in 1528, her ships captured the Portuguese "prince of the sea," Portundo, and in 1541, she freed 340 Spanish prisoners for a ransom. Notably, the Portuguese, despite occupying many northern Moroccan cities, never conquered Tétouan under her rule. Al-Hurra also commanded land forces, participating in sieges of occupied Moroccan cities like Asilah and leading attacks on Ceuta.

In 1541, al-Hurra entered into her second marriage with Sultan Ahmad al-Wattasi, the Wattasid ruler, in a move that underscored her immense political standing. Unusually for the time, the Sultan traveled to Tétouan to marry her, after which she remained in her city while he returned to Fez. This demonstrated her family's status and her importance as a political leader in stabilizing the country, as the Wattasid power was weakening and limited mainly to the capital. This marriage granted her absolute authority and allowed her further leeway in foreign affairs, enabling her to forge more alliances with the Ottomans.

However, this marriage ultimately did not save the Sultan's reign. The Saadi family, based in Marrakech, overthrew the Wattasids in 1549, posing a direct threat to al-Hurra's rule. Her first husband’s family, the Al-Mandris, rebelled against the Wattasids and supported the Saadis in 1542\. Her younger brother also joined the Saadi rebellion, and the death of her main supporter, her older brother Moulay Ibrahim ben Rashid in 1539, left her isolated. Furthermore, a conflict arose between her continued aggressive stance against the Portuguese and her husband's desire for improved relations, which she did not heed. After launching a war against a Portuguese governor and facing betrayal from her younger brother, she was defeated by the Al-Mandris, stripped of her possessions, and forced to return to Chefchaouen, where she lived out the remainder of her life and was buried. Her downfall was a consequence of the broader shift in power across Morocco as the Saadis sought to unify the country and end smaller emirates. Ali Risouni noted that al-Hurra had no children or descendants, and her house after her defeat is now a zawiya, a Sufi institution, and her tomb's location there suggests she may be regarded as a saint.

Today, the qasbah built by her father in Chefchaouen is the primary place where information about Sayyida al-Hurra is displayed. Historian Fatima Bouchmal, who wrote the museum signs in 2011, noted that these displays emphasize al-Hurra's exceptional role as a Moroccan woman who excelled in politics and governance, breaking the stereotype of a princess and distinguishing herself as a strong political and military leader with diplomatic relations. Despite her historical importance, al-Hurra is rarely mentioned in local or regional Arabic history books, with Western sources often reducing her to a "pirate queen". Historians like Fatima Bouchmal attribute this historical marginalization to a patriarchal society that does not traditionally celebrate women in leadership, as well as the French occupation's efforts to suppress positive portrayals of Muslim women. However, there is a renewed interest in her figure, with local historians working to raise awareness about her life and legacy.

According to the available sources, the factors contributing to al-Hurra's exceptional leadership for over three decades included her **respected sharifian lineage, her family’s leadership in the region, her excellent education in various fields, her intelligence, flexibility, fluency in multiple languages, skill in naval warfare, and a strong personality**. Both of her marriages also served the political goal of bringing stability to northern Morocco and enhancing her personal power.

The Barghawatas were a Berber tribal confederation on Morocco's Atlantic coast, belonging to the Masmuda confederacy. They established an independent state between 744 and 1058 CE. Some historians believe the name "Barghawata" is a phonetic deformation of "Barbati," a nickname for their leader Tarif, who is thought to have been born near Barbate, Spain. Other historians, like Jérôme Carcopino, suggest the name is older and refers to the Baquates tribe, who lived near Volubilis until the 7th century. Few details are definitively known about the Barghawata, as most historical sources are posterior to their rule and often present contradictory accounts. However, a tradition from Córdoba, Spain, attributed to Abu Salih Zammur in the mid-10th century, is considered the most detailed concerning the Barghawata.

The Barghawatas participated in the Berber Revolt of 739 or 740, alongside the Ghomara and Miknasa tribes. This revolt was ignited by Sufri Kharijite preachers, a Muslim sect advocating total egalitarianism in opposition to the Umayyad Caliphate's aristocracy. The rebels, led by Maysara al-Matghari, successfully seized control of nearly all of present-day Morocco and inspired further rebellions. They annihilated a Syrian army dispatched by the Umayyad caliph at the Battle of Bagdoura, but the rebel army was later defeated near Kairouan, Ifriqiya, in 741\. Following this, the rebel alliance dissolved. The Barghawatas, as founders of the revolt, grew resentful of attempts by later adherents, particularly Zenata chieftains and authoritarian Sufri commissars, to control the rebellion's leadership. With their primary objective of liberation from Umayyad rule achieved and little prospect of its re-imposition, the Barghawatas saw no point in continued military campaigns. In 742 or 743, they withdrew from the alliance, retreated to the Tamesna region on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, founded their new independent state, and abandoned Sufri Kharijitism.

The Barghawatas ruled the Tamesna region (between Safi and Salé) for over three centuries (744–1058 CE). Under the leadership of Tarif al-Matghari and his successors, the tribal kingdom was consolidated. The kings included Ṣāliḥ ibn Tarīf (declared himself prophet in 744), Ilyas ibn Salih (792-842), Yunus ibn Ilyas (842-888), Abu-Ghufayl Muhammad (888-917), Abu al-Ansar Abdullah (917-961), and Abu Mansur Isa (961-?). They maintained initially good relations with the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordoba, but this broke down at the end of the 10th century, leading to Barghawata fending off Umayyad and Fatimid incursions. From the 11th century, they engaged in intensive guerrilla warfare with the Banu Ifran, which weakened them. Despite this, they successfully repelled Almoravid attacks, even causing the death of the Almoravid spiritual leader, Abdallah ibn Yasin, in battle on July 7, 1058\. The Barghawata were ultimately eliminated as a political and religious group by the Almohads in 1149\.

The Barghawata developed a **syncretic religion** inspired by Islam. This religion incorporated elements of Sunni, Shi'a, and Kharijite Islam, mixed with astrological and traditional Berber mythology. Their unique beliefs included a taboo surrounding eating eggs and chickens, and the belief that the saliva of Salih and his family contained *baraka* (blessedness). The Barghawata confederacy consisted of 29 tribes, with 12 adopting this specific Barghawata religion and 17 adhering to Islam. Some of the tribes adopting the Barghawata religion included Gerawa, Zouagha, Branès, and Matghara, while Khariji Muslim tribes included Zenata-Jbal, Banu Ifren, and Trara. Notably, some constituent tribes, like Branès, Matmata, Ifren, and Trara, were fractions of much larger tribal groups, and only their Tamesna-based segments joined the confederacy. It is also possible that the Barghawata had a Judeo-Berber background, although accounts of entire Berber tribes practicing Judaism are considered unreliable and appear later.

Arabic-language sources provide very sparse details about the Barghawata rulers, particularly for the period after 961 CE, with most accounts relying on later historians quoting older reports, often from Andalusi writers. Few names beyond the early dynastic rulers are preserved in Arabic historiography.

According to Arabic scholarship, the known chronology of Barghawata rulers includes **Salih ibn Tarif** (mid-8th century), **Ilyas ibn Salih** (approximately 792–842), **Yunus ibn Ilyas** (approximately 842–888), and **Abu Ghufayl Muhammad** (approximately 888–913). Salih ibn Tarif is well-attested in Arabic texts, while Ilyas ibn Salih and Yunus ibn Ilyas are mentioned in both Arabic and European reports and by Arabic and Andalusi chroniclers, respectively. Abu Ghufayl Muhammad is identified as the final named ruler before the historical record falls silent.

After Abu Ghufayl Muhammad, around 913 CE, Arabic sources provide no individual names for rulers until the fall of the Barghawata state in 1058 CE. Older chronicle traditions, such as those from al-Bakri, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Khaldun, preserve some mid-10th-century reports, but after that, records become silent, with no Arabic inscriptions or documents found naming rulers from about 913 to 1058\. For this later period, Arabic sources only refer generally to **unnamed tribal chiefs** or **unnamed kings** who opposed the rising Almoravids.

The lack of names after 913 CE may be due to factors such as internal clan rotation or decentralized leadership, as suggested by Arabic historians like Ibn Khaldun. Additionally, the Barghawata’s own internal records and Tamazight-language narratives have not survived. Arabic historians often considered the Barghawata heretical and therefore frequently dismissed them without detailed records. Consequently, any claims of specific names for rulers in the period between 961 and 1058 CE likely originate from speculative reconstructions or oral tradition rather than verified Arabic documentation.

Amazigh tattooing, known as *oucham*, *tichrad*, or *tagezzayt*, is a sophisticated visual language historically inscribed on the skin of indigenous Amazigh communities in North Africa for millennia. It functions as a complex, non-literate system of communication, a visible archive of cultural memory, and a profound expression of identity, spirituality, and social standing. Primarily practiced by and for women, these tattoos constitute a powerful nexus of cultural heritage and female agency, making the decorated female body a public and permanent symbol of a distinct identity. In a culture where history was often transmitted orally, the body itself served as a text, conveying tribal affiliation, personal milestones, and deeply held beliefs about the cosmos. The practice was not uniform across the vast Amazigh territory, Tamazgha, but rather formed a dynamic lexicon of symbols and patterns that varied by tribe, region, and family, reflecting the rich diversity of Amazigh groups. This tradition operated as a parallel system of cultural inheritance, a matrilineal archive passed from mother to daughter, preserving a uniquely female-centric worldview focused on protection, fertility, community, and resilience, outside of patriarchal textual traditions.

The tradition of Amazigh tattooing has profound antiquity, rooted in the pre-Islamic era of North Africa and stretching back thousands of years, as evidenced by tattooed mummies in the region. Scholarly inquiry connects its geometric motifs to abstract symbols found in Neolithic rock art from the Capsian period (circa 7500–4000 BC). These archaic geometrical designs, featuring dots, circles, chevrons, and rectilinear combinations, are considered by some prehistorians to be the genesis of a symbolic writing system that may have given rise to the Libyco-Berber alphabet, Tifinagh. This suggests tattooing is a vital branch of a comprehensive system of Amazigh graphic communication, sharing an ancestral vocabulary with patterns on pottery, textiles, and jewelry.

Beyond aesthetics, Amazigh tattoos primarily served an apotropaic function, acting as "permanent amulets" (*h'erz*) to ward off evil spirits (*jnoun*) and deflect the evil eye. This belief dictated strategic placement, often near potential spiritual entry points like the eyes, nostrils, and mouth, or on vulnerable areas like the hands, feet, and ankles. The practice was also deeply intertwined with magico-medical rituals and therapeutic healing, believed to have curative properties for specific physical ailments or to prevent disease. For example, neck patterns were thought to protect against goiter, and ankle markings could treat leg numbness. The *Dem en-nfasse* ("blood of childbirth") tattoo on external ankles was believed to facilitate easy delivery.

The application of an Amazigh tattoo was a sacred, female-centric ritual marking significant life transitions. It was overseen by a *tatoueuse*, typically an elder woman respected for her knowledge of symbols and rituals. Simple tools like a needle or sharpened Barbary fig thorn were used. The desired pattern was first drawn with soot or charcoal, then meticulously pricked into the skin until blood was drawn. The pigment, creating a characteristic blue-green hue, was a mixture of natural ingredients like soot, carbon black, *khol* (antimony), or gunpowder, rubbed into the fresh wounds. A paste called *tizegzawt*, made from macerated plants like bean leaves or black nightshade, was repeatedly applied to enhance and fix the color as the skin healed. The pain endured during this process was an integral component of the rite of passage, signifying a woman's strength and readiness for the next stage of life. This process marked key milestones: a girl's entry into puberty, her marriage, and the birth of her children. The first facial tattoo, the *siyala*—a vertical line on the chin—was typically applied at the onset of menstruation, signifying the transition from girl to woman, capable of motherhood and carrying tribal heritage. The permanent mark was a badge of honor, symbolizing resilience and full integration into the community's social and spiritual fabric, charging the "permanent amulet" with the wearer's fortitude and life force.

The symbolic language of Amazigh tattoos is a rich vocabulary drawn from geometry, nature, the cosmos, and human experience, forming a cohesive aesthetic system present across all forms of female-created art, including textiles, pottery, and jewelry. Fundamental geometric shapes form the core of this lexicon, each imbued with layers of meaning. The **`diamond (lozenge ⯈)`** is the quintessential representation of femininity, the womb, protection for the family, and the home. It is often associated with the serpent, symbolizing a union of feminine and masculine/virile principles. The **triangle (ⵜ or Δ)** is a potent symbol of fertility and life. An upward-pointing triangle signifies fire, masculinity, and virility, while a downward-pointing triangle symbolizes water, femininity, and life-giving forces. Their combination forms a hexagram, representing harmony. **Lines and dots** carry significant weight; straight lines often represent the path of life, family lineage, or the connection between terrestrial and divine. Dots frequently symbolize seeds, a metaphor for fertility and new life, and can map out genealogies or the endurance of a family line. The **cross (+ or ⵍ)**, predating Christian influence, represents the four cardinal directions, serving as a sign of guidance, spiritual protection, and balance. It can also symbolize the eye of God.

The Amazigh worldview is deeply connected to the natural and cosmic environment, reflected in their symbolic vocabulary. **Fauna** symbols include the **serpent (ⵖ)**, representing virility, regeneration, healing, and protection against evil spirits. The **scorpion (𓆙)** is a paradoxical symbol of danger and death, yet also a powerful protector and symbol of defense and resilience. **Birds (𓅃)** are seen as messengers between heaven and earth, symbolizing freedom, vision, and agility, with the "Partridge Eye" motif representing feminine beauty and grace. The **fish (𓆈)**, living in water, symbolizes abundance, prosperity, safety, and protection against the evil eye. The **frog** and **spider** are feminine symbols; the frog is associated with fertility and magical rituals, while the spider represents patient, laborious, and harmonious domestic life. **Flora** symbols include the **palm tree** (*siyala*), the most iconic facial tattoo (a vertical line on the chin), directly invoking fertility and life, strongly associated with the ancient goddess Tanit. **Seeds (ⵇ)** represent male seed, potential, new beginnings, and the life cycle. **Wheat or barley** symbolize both life and sustenance, and the cyclical nature of harvest. **Cosmology** is represented by the **sun (☀)** and **moon (☾)**, signifying fundamental duality; the sun symbolizes life, energy, enlightenment, and the masculine principle, while the moon represents femininity, regeneration, the cycles of life and death, and the passage of time.

Beyond the natural world, symbols also serve as direct markers of identity, status, and spiritual defense. The **Yaz (ⵣ)**, resembling the Tifinagh letter for "Z," is the most recognizable emblem of Amazigh identity, representing the "Free Man" (*Amazigh*), freedom, resilience, and cultural pride. The **Eye (ⵄ)** is a direct apotropaic mark for protection against the evil eye, often with a cross within it to deflect malevolent forces. The **Hand of Fatima (Khamsa or ⵛ)**, though shared with other cultures, is widely used in Amazigh art for protection, especially for women and children. The **weaving comb**, an essential tool for women's textile creation, is a feminine symbol of creativity, fertility, order, and harmonious movement.

The Souss region of southern Morocco, the heartland of the Chleuh people (the largest Amazigh group), maintains a distinctive culture characterized by the Tashelhit language, unique customs, and rich artistic heritage. Women have traditionally been primary artisans, their creative endeavors providing economic independence and acting as the main vehicle for transmitting cultural symbols. Despite this cultural richness, direct and detailed textual descriptions of specific Souss tattoo patterns are notably scarce in ethnographic records, likely due to oral and matrilineal transmission and potential biases in historical research. Understanding Souss tattoo patterns requires analyzing visual evidence, such as photographs of young women from the Ida Ou Zekri tribe bearing facial tattoos, and cross-referencing them with the general Amazigh symbolic lexicon. A comprehensive understanding can also be achieved by treating the region's broader material culture as a "Rosetta Stone". The women who received and administered tattoos were also the weavers of textiles and makers of symbolic jewelry, creating a unified visual language. The Souss, particularly around Tiznit, is renowned for its distinctive silver and enamel jewelry, which features geometric patterns like lozenges, triangles, chevrons, and dots and lines. The prevalence of the lozenge (diamond) shape, symbolizing femininity and protection, in Tiznit fibulae strongly suggests it was a dominant motif in Souss tattooing. Similarly, the geometric complexity and symbolic density in the region's carpets and textiles, exclusively women's work, reflect a sophisticated visual language centered on fertility, protection, and tribal identity.

The Doukkala region, a coastal plain south of Casablanca, presents a more complex and layered history of tattooing due to profound cultural transformation and syncretism. Historically, "Doukkala" referred to a powerful confederation of Amazigh tribes, predominantly Masmuda and Sanhaja groups, who formed a core part of the independent Barghawata confederation from 744 to 1058 AD. This deep history establishes an undeniable Amazigh cultural substrate in the region that would have included ancient tattooing traditions. The 12th century marked a pivotal and violent turning point with the Almohad conquest. After defeating the Doukkala tribes who sided with the Almoravids, Abd al-Mu'min purged populations and settled large numbers of Arab Bedouin tribes, notably the Banu Hilal, fundamentally altering the demographic and cultural landscape. This led to centuries of linguistic and cultural mixing and gradual Arabization of the remaining Amazigh population.

Despite this history of Arabization, tattooing persisted in Doukkala well into the 20th century, understood as a syncretic blend, an "Arabo-Amazigh" cultural fusion. A 1949 study in *Hespéris* confirmed the practice, noting that "Among the Doukkala... these tattoos are common: 36 on the right shoulder, 10 on the left shoulder, out of 89 tattooed individuals," providing specific data on placement. For tribes near El Jadida, such as the Oulad Bouaziz (descendants of Hilalian migrations), their cultural practices, including tattooing, would have been part of this syncretic regional tradition, likely including a mix of ancient Amazigh geometric patterns absorbed from original inhabitants and motifs characteristic of Bedouin Arab traditions. The challenge in defining a purely "Amazigh" tattoo lexicon for Doukkala lies in this assimilation and the nature of its documentation; French colonial ethnography often miscategorized the local tattooing tradition as simply "Arab" or a general "rural" custom, overlooking surviving Amazigh elements. This has resulted in an "ethnographic silence" where the specific Amazigh symbolic language was transformed, assimilated, and miscategorized, rather than entirely vanishing.

The ancient tradition of Amazigh tattooing has experienced a sharp decline since the mid-20th century, bringing it to the brink of disappearance. This decline is attributed to a confluence of social, religious, and political forces. **Religious proscription** is a primary driver, with stricter interpretations of Sunni Islam widely considering tattooing *haram* (forbidden) as an alteration of God's creation. This discourse gained traction from the 1970s, creating social pressure and shame, leading many women to regret their tattoos or attempt painful removal. **Modernization and urbanization** eroded the social context of tattoos; a tattoo signifying tribal membership or readiness for marriage lost its function in urban centers. **The colonial gaze and shifting beauty standards** also played a role. While some Amazigh women reportedly used tattoos as a form of resistance against colonial soldiers, French colonial ethnography often framed tattooing as "primitive". Furthermore, the French establishment of brothels, sometimes involving abducted tattooed rural Amazigh women, created a damaging association between tattoos and prostitution in the urban colonial mindset. This stigma, coupled with post-independence globalized beauty standards, marginalized traditional tattoos as outdated.

Despite decades of decline, the 21st century has witnessed a powerful renaissance of Amazigh tattoo symbolism, driven by a new generation of Moroccans connecting with their ancestral heritage. This revival adapts the ancient symbolic lexicon to the modern art of ink tattooing, rather than returning to past ritualistic practices. Tattoo studios in major Moroccan cities are increasingly receiving requests for designs based on traditional Amazigh motifs, with artists becoming new custodians, researching meanings and creating contemporary designs. For this new generation, symbols represent empowerment, pride, and a public declaration of Amazigh identity. The Yaz (ⵣ), in particular, has become an iconic symbol of this movement, transforming the tattoo from a tribal marker into a broader statement of belonging to a transnational Amazigh culture, linking past and present, and celebrating human expression.

The tradition of Amazigh tattooing is a profound and complex cultural phenomenon, a visual language inscribed on the body that serves as a living document of history, spirituality, and female-centric heritage. These markings, rooted in the Neolithic period, functioned as permanent amulets for protection, sacred rites of passage, and a matrilineal archive for transmitting cultural values. Regional variations are evident; in the Souss Valley, tattoos are part of a cohesive Amazigh artistic heritage shared across textiles, jewelry, and skin, with its essence reconstructible through rich material culture. In contrast, the Doukkala plains show a cultural layering where an ancient Amazigh practice was transformed by centuries of Arabization, obscuring original elements in historical records. The modern era, with religious orthodoxy, urbanization, and shifting beauty standards, brought the tradition to near disappearance. However, the enduring power of these symbols is evident in their contemporary renaissance, reclaimed by a new generation for cultural pride, identity, and empowerment.

For individuals seeking a deeper connection with this ancestral heritage, consulting key ethnographic texts like *Amazigh Arts in Morocco* by Cynthia J. Becker, articles on tattooing by Susan Searight, and historical archives of the journal *Hespéris* is recommended. Engaging with contemporary artists, who are the new custodians and interpreters of this art form, is also a direct way to connect with the evolving tradition. Finally, exploring material culture collections, such as the Musée Pierre Bergé des arts berbères in Marrakech, which holds a significant collection of Amazigh artifacts including textiles, jewelry, pottery, and woodwork, provides an immersive education in the geometric patterns and symbolic motifs that once adorned the skin.

The chronology of Barghawata rulers, spanning from 744 to 1058 CE, can be organized by their historical reliability. **Salih ibn Tarif**, the founder, is considered reliable by ancient Arabic sources such as Ibn Khaldun and al-Bakri, and he is noted for claiming prophecy and establishing a unique sacred book around 744 to 792 CE. His successor, **Ilyas ibn Salih**, who reigned from approximately 792 to 842 CE, is also reliably attested and is known for emphasizing the Barghawata creed and persecuting Muslims.

Following Ilyas ibn Salih was **Yunus ibn Ilyas**, whose rule from 842 to 888 CE is reliably documented. He is noted for moderating the persecution and favoring stability. The state's military power is said to have reached its peak under **Abu Ghufayl Muhammad ibn Yunus**, whose reign from 888 to 917 CE is also considered reliable.

After Abu Ghufayl Muhammad, the historical record becomes less definitive. **Abu al-Ansar Abdullah** is mentioned in popular sources and later Arabic allusions as a ruler from 917 to 961 CE, said to have restored the state's strength. Subsequently, **Abu Mansur Isa ibn Abi al-Ansar** is considered semi-reliable for a period after 961 CE, notably due to an embassy sent to al-Hakam al-Mustansir Billah in Andalusia in 963 CE, which historically confirms his existence.

For the period after Abu Mansur Isa until the fall of the Barghawata state in 1058 CE, the available sources mention a gap in specific named rulers. While **Abu Hafs Abdullah** is sometimes mentioned in popular or unproven accounts as a later leader, and an **"Ibn Abi al-Ansar"** without a specific name also appears in some blogs, these names are not explicitly supported by classical Arabic sources. Ibn Khaldun's accounts for this later period only refer to **unnamed kings** who fought against the Almoravids, indicating a lack of specific names for the final rulers. The Barghawata state ultimately fell in 1058 CE at the hands of the Almoravids, led by Abdallah ibn Yasin, without any named final rulers in the historical record.

The history of human habitation in Morocco extends to the Lower Paleolithic period, with archaeological evidence showing hominids present at least 400,000 years ago in Salé, and early *Homo sapiens* dating back 300,000 years at Jebel Irhoud. Small perforated seashell beads discovered in Taforalt are 82,000 years old, representing the earliest known evidence of personal adornment. During Mesolithic times (20,000 to 5000 years ago), Morocco was a savanna environment, hospitable to hunters and gatherers of the Capsian culture. The Neolithic period saw hunters and herders flourish, with the domestication of cattle and cultivation of crops. The coastal regions shared in the Cardium pottery culture, common throughout the Mediterranean. In the Chalcolithic or copper age, the Beaker culture reached Morocco's north coast.

Recorded history began with the **Phoenician colonization** of the Moroccan coast between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. Phoenician traders established depots for salt and ore along the coast and rivers, with major early settlements at Chellah, Lixus, and Mogador. By the 5th century BCE, **Carthage** extended its hegemony over much of North Africa, developing commercial relations with Berber tribes of the interior and paying them tribute for raw materials. This period marked the beginning of centuries of foreign rule in northern Morocco.

The independent tribal Berber kingdom of **Mauretania** emerged around the 3rd century BCE on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, corresponding to northern modern-day Morocco. Early recorded history mentions Phoenician and Carthaginian settlements, but indigenous Berber kings ruled inland territories. Mauretania became a client state of the Roman Empire in 33 BCE and a full province, Mauretania Tingitana, around 39 or 40 CE, with Volubilis as its capital. Roman control was primarily alliances with tribes rather than military occupation, extending only to economically useful or defensible areas. During Emperor Augustus's reign, three Roman citizen colonies were founded near the Atlantic coast. Christianity was introduced in the 2nd century CE and gained converts, leading to Christianization of Romanized areas by the late 4th century. The region also had a substantial Jewish population.

The region was conquered by Muslims in the early 8th century CE, bringing Arabic and Islam to the area. Morocco was initially a subsidiary province of Ifriqiya, with local governors appointed from Kairouan. Indigenous Berber tribes adopted Islam but retained customary laws and paid taxes to the new administration. In 740 CE, spurred by Kharijite agitators, the Berber population revolted against the ruling Umayyad Caliphate. The **Berber Revolt** spread quickly, and by 742 CE, Morocco had broken away from Umayyad and Abbasid control, fragmenting into small, independent Berber states.

Among these independent states were the **Barghawata** (744–1058), a confederation of Berber groups inhabiting the Atlantic coast, who established an independent state in the Tamesna region under Tarif al-Matghari after allying with the Sufri Kharijite rebellion. The **Emirate of Sijilmasa** (757–976) was founded by the Midrarid dynasty in the Tafilalt region, becoming an important trade center at the northern edge of the Sahara. The **Kingdom of Nekor** (710–1019) was an emirate in the Rif area, founded by Salih I ibn Mansur and ruled by the Banū Sālih dynasty. It even faced a Viking incursion in 859\.

The **Idrisid dynasty** (788–974), founded by Idris I, is considered the founder of the first Moroccan state. Idris I, a great-grandchild of Hasan ibn Ali, fled to the Maghreb after a battle near Mecca and settled in Volubilis in 788\. The powerful Awraba Berbers welcomed him as their 'imam' and he began asserting authority, founding a settlement called Medinat Fas in 789\. After Idris I was poisoned in 791, his son Idris II continued his work. Idris II (791–828) weakened Awraba power by inviting Arab settlers and moving his seat of government to Fes, which he developed and gave a more Arab character. By his death, the Idrisid state spanned from western Algeria to the Sous in southern Morocco, becoming the leading state, though Sijilmasa, Barghawata, and Nekor remained outside their control.

Following Idris II, the dynasty's power declined due to divisions among his sons, forming eight Idrisid statelets. During this time, Islamic and Arabic culture gained a stronghold in towns like Fes, which became an important religious center. However, the Idrisids primarily ruled the towns, with most of Morocco's population still speaking Berber languages and adhering to various Islamic doctrines. The decline accelerated after Yahya I's death in 863, with further divisions and Berber Khariji-Sufri tribes forming a front against them. The **Fatimids** from the east and **Umayyads** of Cordoba intervened, with the Miknasa tribe acting on behalf of the Fatimids. After various shifts in allegiance and internal conflicts, the Idrisids were ultimately expelled from their territories by the Umayyads in 974, bringing an end to the dynasty. Despite their fall, the Idrisids spawned many sharifian families, and their tombs became important pilgrimage sites in Fes and Moulay Idriss.

The **Almoravid dynasty** (c.1060–1147) originated among the Lamtuna nomadic Berber tribe of the Sanhaja. They unified Morocco in the late 10th century, annexing the Emirate of Sijilmasa and the Barghawata. Under Yusuf ibn Tashfin, they were invited to Al-Andalus to defend against Christian kingdoms, successfully repelling Christian forces and annexing most of the major *taifas*. The Almoravid power began to decline in the first half of the 12th century after a defeat at the Battle of Ourique and the rise of the Almohads. Their dynasty fell with the Almohad conquest of Marrakech in 1147\. The Almoravid movement was fueled by the puritan zeal of Abdallah ibn Yasin, who advocated for conquest as a necessary extension of Islamicization, identifying tribalism as an obstacle to the unity of Muslims under sacred law.

The **Almohad Caliphate** (c. 1121–1269) was founded in the 12th century by Ibn Tumart among the Masmuda Berber tribes in the Atlas Mountains of southern Morocco. Ibn Tumart developed a strict unitarian doctrine (*tawhid*) in revolt against anthropomorphism in Muslim orthodoxy, and his followers were known as *al-Muwaḥḥidūn* ("those who affirm the unity of God"). Around 1120, Ibn Tumart established a Berber state in Tinmel, serving as both a spiritual and military center. Despite a devastating defeat at the Battle of al-Buhayra in 1130, the movement survived under Abd al-Mu'min, who became Caliph after Ibn Tumart's death. Abd al-Mu'min (1130–1163) not only eliminated the Almoravids but extended Almohad power across North Africa as far as Egypt and into the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus). The Almohads transferred the capital of Muslim Iberia from Córdoba to Seville, where they built a great mosque and a palace. However, the Almohad advance was broken by a coalition of Christian kings at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212\. Internal coups and the inability to protect Andalusian cities led to the end of the Almohad era in Spain by 1228, followed by a massive Christian reconquista. In Africa, the Almohads lost territories due to tribal revolts, particularly from the Banu Marin (Marinids). The last Almohad ruler, Idris II, was murdered in Marrakech in 1269, marking the fall of the dynasty.

The **Marinid dynasty** (c. 1244–1465) was of Berber origin, although they claimed Arab ancestry. They entered Morocco in the early 13th century, initially submitting to the Almohads before rising as a political power. They gradually seized major cities like Taza, Rabat, Salé, Meknes, and Fez from the weakened Almohads, capturing Marrakech in 1269\. The Marinids actively participated in conflicts in Iberia, aiming to control the Strait of Gibraltar, and occupied several Spanish towns. In 1276, they founded Fes Jdid, making it their administrative and military center, and the Marinid period marked Fes's golden age as an intellectual center, with the establishment of the first madrasas in the city and country. At their height under Abu al-Hasan Ali (r. 1331–1348), the Marinids briefly reunited the Maghreb, controlling a vast territory from southern Morocco to Tripoli. However, the dynasty declined after Abu Inan Faris's death in 1358, with power shifting to viziers, political anarchy, division of the country, and European attacks on the coast. A financial crisis further weakened the state, leading to a massacre of the Wattasid family by Sultan Abdalhaqq II in 1459, who was then murdered in the 1465 revolt, ending the Marinid dynasty.

The **Wattasid dynasty** (c. 1472–1554) assumed power when Morocco was in decline. They had been autonomous governors of the eastern Rif and had close ties to the Marinids. After a power struggle, Abu Abd Allah al-Sheikh Muhammad ibn Yahya founded the Kingdom of Fez and established the dynasty. However, the Wattasid rulers failed to protect Morocco from foreign incursions, and the Portuguese increased their presence on the coast. This contrasted with the military successes of the rising **Saadian dynasty** in the south, which seized Marrakech in 1524 and defeated the Portuguese at Agadir in 1537\. The Saadians were regarded as heroes by the people, enabling them to retake Portuguese strongholds. They eventually attacked and overthrew the Wattasids, killing their last sultan in 1554\.

The **Saadi dynasty** (1549–1659) was the first of the Sharifian dynasties, claiming descent from Prophet Muhammad. They initially controlled only southern areas but their growing power led to the Wattasids recognizing their rule over southern Morocco by 1528\. From 1549, they ruled the entire region. In 1590, Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur's expedition to the Songhai Empire resulted in its collapse and the establishment of the Pashalik of Timbuktu. The Saadi dynasty fell in 1659, when Mohammed al-Hajj ibn Abu Bakr al-Dila'i was proclaimed sultan.

The **Republic of Salé** (1624–1668) originated in the early 17th century with the arrival of Moriscos from Spain, who settled in Rabat across the Bou Regreg river from Salé. These communities thrived as pirates, expanding operations in the Mediterranean and Atlantic. In 1624, the Dutchman Jan Janszoon became "Grand Admiral" and President of the Corsair Republic. After Janszoon left, the Moriscos declared a Republic, ruled by a council. By 1641, the Zaouia of Dila imposed religious hegemony, and eventually, Sultan Al-Rashid of the Alawi dynasty seized Rabat and Salé, ending its independence by 1668\.

The **Alawi dynasty** (since 1666\) is the current Moroccan royal family, claiming descent from Prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatima az-Zahrah. Sharif ibn Ali became Prince of Tafilalt in 1631, and his son Mulay Al-Rashid (1664–1672) unified the country. The Alawi kingdom was consolidated by Ismail Ibn Sharif (1672–1727), who created a unified state through an army of slaves, reoccupying Tangiers in 1684 and driving the Spanish from Larache in 1689\. However, after his death, power struggles resumed, and the kingdom was only unified again under Muhammad III (1757–1790), who allowed tribes to preserve their autonomy. On December 20, 1777, Morocco became the first state to recognize the sovereignty of the newly independent United States. During the reigns of Muhammad IV (1859–1873) and Hassan I (1873–1894), the Alawis fostered trade links, modernized the army and administration, but Morocco's independence was increasingly influenced by European powers, leading to the Madrid Conference of 1880 and the Moroccan Crises of 1905–1906 and 1911\.

**European influence** intensified from the mid-19th century. After the French conquest of Algeria, the Franco-Moroccan War occurred in 1844\. The Anglo-Moroccan Treaty of 1856 opened up Morocco to foreign trade, reducing the Makhzen's control. The Hispano-Moroccan War (1859–1860) led to Morocco taking a large British loan to pay war debts. Morocco's instability and economic concessions led to increased European intervention. French influence grew significantly, opposed by Germany, but the Algeciras Conference of 1906 formalized France's "special position". A civil war, the Hafidiya (1907), saw Abd al-Hafid seize the throne from his brother, supported by different European factions.

The **French and Spanish protectorate** was established by the Treaty of Fez on March 30, 1912, after the Agadir Crisis. Spain was granted a zone of influence in northern and southern Morocco. Tangier received special status as an international zone. Under the protectorate, the sultan remained a figurehead, but real power lay with the colonial administration, which focused on exploiting Morocco's mineral wealth, developing infrastructure, and promoting a modern agricultural sector. Tens of thousands of colonists acquired large tracts of land.

**Nationalism and anti-colonial resistance** emerged. The independent **Republic of the Rif** (1921–1926), led by Abd el-Krim, existed in the Spanish Protectorate, but was eventually suppressed by Spanish and French troops. Nationalist groups like the *Comité d'Action Marocaine* (CAM) proposed reforms and later formed political parties, but faced French suppression. The **Istiqlal Party's Manifesto of Independence** in January 1944 established Sultan Muhammad V as a symbol of the nationalist struggle. The French regime faced opposition from tribes, and the exile of Sultan Muhammad V in 1953 sparked active opposition and rising violence. Faced with Moroccan demands and a deteriorating situation in Algeria, the French brought Muhammad V back to Morocco, leading to negotiations for independence.

**Independent Morocco** began in late 1955, with Sultan Mohammed V negotiating gradual restoration of independence. Morocco acquired limited home rule in February 1956, and full independence was formalized with the French-Moroccan Agreement on March 22, 1956\. Spain relinquished its protectorate in April 1956, and Tangier was reintegrated in October 1956\. Mohammed V established a modern governmental structure under a constitutional monarchy, assuming the title Mohammed V in 1957\. His son, **King Hassan II** (1961–1999), faced significant political unrest, known as "the years of lead." He oversaw new constitutions and parliamentary government, but also military coups. Border skirmishes with Algeria escalated into the **Sand War** in 1963\. In 1973, Hassan II announced the **Moroccanization** policy, transferring foreign-owned businesses and assets to political loyalists. Morocco also participated in the Yom Kippur War in 1973, deploying troops to the Syrian front.

The **Western Sahara conflict** began with Spain ceding administration of the territory to Morocco and Mauritania in early 1976\. Morocco took control of the northern two-thirds, while the **Polisario Front** declared the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) and formed a government-in-exile. Morocco sent combat forces to confront the Polisario, leading to intensive warfare. Mauritania renounced its claim in 1979, and Morocco annexed the entire territory, building a 2,500-kilometer sand berm. A UN peace plan and cease-fire went into effect in 1991, but the status of the territory remains unresolved. Political reforms in the 1990s led to a new bicameral legislature.

Upon the death of Hassan II in 1999, **King Mohammed VI** (since 1999\) enacted reforms, improving human rights, releasing political prisoners, and establishing a commission for compensation. Berber-language instruction was introduced in primary schools, and a new family law (Mudawana) was enacted in 2004, addressing some women's rights demands. Morocco faced a crisis with Spain over the island of Perejil/Toura in 2002\. In May 2003, Islamist suicide bombers struck Casablanca, leading to a crackdown on extremists. The US designated Morocco a major non-NATO ally in recognition of its counter-terrorism efforts. Free trade agreements were signed with the US and EU.

In February 2011, protests calling for political reform and a new constitution emerged during the "Arab Spring." A bombing in Marrakesh occurred in April 2011\. A constitutional referendum was approved in July 2011, recognizing Amazigh as an official language. The **Hirak Rif Movement** began in October 2016 following the death of a fish seller. In 2017, Morocco rejoined the African Union. The COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020\. In December 2020, the United States recognized Morocco's claims over Western Sahara as part of the **Israel–Morocco normalization agreement**. Diplomatic crises with Spain and Algeria occurred in 2021\. The Amazigh New Year was declared an official national holiday in May 2023\. A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck Morocco in September 2023, causing significant loss of life and injury.

This document explores the history, culture, and science in Morocco from the 11th to the 14th centuries, particularly focusing on the role of the Almoravids and Almohads, and the scientific contributions in mathematics, astronomy, and geography. It highlights Morocco's significant but often overlooked role in elevating the human condition and serving as a crucial route for the exchange of ideas and people between East and West, especially after Sicily became unsafe for Muslim travelers in the late 11th century.

One illustration of Morocco's transit role is the spread of paper manufacturing. Originating in China and brought to the Islamic lands, paper production moved from Baghdad to Syria, then Palestine, reaching Egypt around 850 CE, Morocco by the early 10th century, and Spain by 950 CE. From Spain and Sicily, paper-making then spread to Italy and the rest of Europe.

There was a close relationship between Moroccan territories and Al-Andalus (Muslim Spain). Maghribi students, for instance, considered a stay in Cordova, Murcia, or Valencia necessary to complete their studies until the 13th century. Economic links were also strong, with Morocco serving as a source of raw materials and a market for finished goods from Al-Andalus. Under the Almoravid and Almohad dynasties, which unified Islamic Spain with the Maghrib, Moroccan cities like Marrakech and Fes became extensions of the Andalusi urban economy, facilitating free movement of merchants and goods. Jewish families, heavily involved in Muslim trade, often had homes on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar to ease commercial arrangements.

Morocco's main contribution to the history and geopolitics of the Islamic western region was the rise of two powerful Muslim forces: the Almoravid and Almohad dynasties. These dynasties are often negatively portrayed in historical literature, such as in the film *El-Cid*, where Almoravids are depicted as evil and cruel, contrasting with a romanticized El-Cid, who was in reality a mercenary. The Almohads, too, are frequently described as fanatical and orthodox barbarians who harmed Muslim civilization.

The **Almoravids** intervened in Spanish affairs in 1086, a period when Muslim Spain was fragmented into feuding "Taifas de Reyes" (small kingdoms), exploited by Christian neighbors for the "Reconquista". The taking of Barbastro by combined Christian forces in 1065 marked a significant turning point. Facing intensified threats, the Taifa rulers, under pressure from their populations, appealed to the Almoravids for help. In 1086, Almoravid tribesmen from southern Morocco crossed into Spain and inflicted a decisive defeat on Christian forces at Zallaqa near Badajoz, intimidating them with their continuous drumming and swift maneuvers. Alfonso VI of Castile barely escaped, with thousands of his best knights perishing.

Initially, the Almoravids' puritanical faith was not welcomed by the more liberal Andalusians, and Yusuf Ibn Tashfin, their ruler, was even plotted against. However, after two previous interventions, in 1090, Ibn Tashfin returned, removed the Taifa rulers, and established Almoravid rule over all of Muslim Spain. Despite their crucial role, the Almoravids suffered from historical prejudices, with contemporary historians like Al-Bakri wrongly regarding them as "savages" and their conquest as a "bloody holy war waged by fanatical disciples of a strange religion".

In reality, the Almoravids conquered Morocco patiently, and their establishment in Marrakech and rapid expansion demonstrated a considerable degree of cultural evolution and assimilation. They secured prosperity for the region by drawing on African goldmines for coinage and were the first to unify Spain and Northwest Africa, which had profound economic and cultural repercussions. More importantly, the Almoravid intervention kept Spain in Muslim hands for another half-century (until their fall in 1147\) and halted the Castilian advance, allowing Muslim civilization to prosper for an extended period.

The **Almohads** continued this legacy, extending Muslim political survival in Al-Andalus and the prosperity of Muslim civilization until nearly the mid-13th century. Eminent scholars and thinkers, such as the herbalists Al-Ghafiqi and Ibn al-Baytar, the traveler Ibn Jubayr, the philosopher Ibn Rushd, and the astronomer Jabir Ibn Aflah, lived under Almoravid and Almohad rule.

After Ibn Tashfin’s death, the Almoravid kingdom succumbed to corruption and anarchy, with their once-hardy warriors losing their martial habits to a life of ease and luxury. This led to renewed chaos and infighting in Muslim Spain, which fragmented again into warring city-states. Christian forces, under King Alfonso I of Aragon, resumed their assaults, capturing towns and cities.

The Almohads, another Berber dynasty from deeper into Morocco, crossed into Spain and once again saved Muslim Spain, defeating Castilian armies. In 1196, the Almohad ruler Abu Yusuf Ya’qub inflicted a crushing defeat on Alfonso VIII of Castile at Alarcos. Abu Yusuf was notably generous in victory, freeing twenty thousand Christian prisoners without ransom. Though he was forced to cut short his operations in Spain due to a rebellion in Africa, his actions secured Spain and North Africa for Muslim rule for a while longer.

Abu Ya’qub, the father of Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur, brought peace and security and improved irrigation systems and embellished cities with fine buildings in both Spain and North-West Africa. He made Seville his capital in 1170-1171, restoring the Alcazar and building the main mosque, whose minaret is now known as the Giralda, which also served as an observatory.

In Morocco, Almohad rule was a period of great prosperity and brilliance of learning. They built the Marrakech Kutubiya Mosque, which accommodated 25,000 people and was famed for its extensive collection of books, manuscripts, libraries, and bookshops. Abu Ya’qub was a great collector of books and founded a public library in Marrakech, managed by the most erudite scholars. Some books in the library were considered as prized as precious metals. During the Crusades, the Almohads dispatched 180 vessels to aid Muslims in the East. Almohad sovereigns encouraged the construction of schools and libraries, sponsored scholars, and even attended their funerals. Illustrious physicians, philosophers, and scholars such as Ibn Rushd, Ibn Tufayl, and Ibn Zuhr thrived under the Almohad court. Libraries, including private collections, flourished, with some requiring five camel loads to transport.

However, Almohad rule eventually met the same fate as its predecessors. Abu Yusuf Al-Mansur was succeeded by his son Al-Nasir (1199-1214), who was indifferent to science and religion and focused on pleasure. At the decisive Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, Al-Nasir's superior but disunited army was crushed by a smaller, unified Spanish force. This marked the beginning of the end for Muslim Spain, with Cordova (1236), Valencia (1238), and Seville (1248) falling, leaving only Granada until 1492\. Without a strong North African army to intervene, the Spanish and Portuguese began thrusting into North Africa in the 15th century, only to be met by the rising power of the Ottomans.

Morocco was a significant center of **mathematical studies**. Two famous scholars, Al-Murrakushi and Ibn al-Banna, contributed to arithmetic, astronomy, geometry, algebra, chemistry, and history. While Al-Murrakushi's career flourished in Egypt, his contributions reflect his Moroccan education. Ibn al-Banna, a fully Moroccan scientist, led an original scientific school in the late medieval Islamic west.

**Abd al-Wahid Al-Murrakushi**, born in Marrakech in 1185, studied in Marrakech, Fes, and Spain before moving to Egypt in 1217\. In 1224, he completed a history of the Almohad dynasty, *Kitab al-mu’jib fi talkhis akhbar ahl al-Maghrib*. His main scientific work is *Jami’ al-Mabadi’ wa-‘l-ghayat fi ‘ilm al-miqat* (The compendium of principles and results in the science of timekeeping), completed around 1229-1230. This work is a compilation of practical knowledge on astronomical instruments, trigonometry, and gnomonics. Sarton praised it as the most elaborate trigonometrical treatise of the Western caliphate and the best medieval treatise on practical astronomy and graphical methods, including studies of various sundial surfaces for every latitude. Al-Murrakushi included tables of sines, versed sines, and arc sines, and showed familiarity with the works of prominent Islamic mathematicians and astronomers. His work demonstrates that advanced trigonometry existed centuries before it was believed to have developed in 14th-century Oxford and France.

**Ibn al-Banna**, whose full name was Abu ‘l-Abbas Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Uthman al-Azdi, was born in Marrakech in 1256 and spent most of his life in Morocco. He lived and taught in Fes, which became the capital of the Merinids after the fall of the Almohads. At the university in Fes, he taught arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and astronomy. Ibn al-Banna was highly prolific, with over 100 titles across disciplines like linguistics, rhetoric, astrology, grammar, logic, mathematics, and astronomy. Honored by the Merinids, he even published *Tanbih al-albab*, a book containing mathematical solutions to everyday problems such as medicament composition, irrigation canal calculations, and detecting measurement frauds. In mathematics, he is credited with being the first to consider a fraction as a ratio and to use the term "almanac". His works *Talkhis a’mal al-hisab* and its commentary *Raf’ al-Hijab* introduced mathematical notation, leading some to believe he was among the first in Islam to develop algebraic symbolism.

Morocco also produced several renowned **geographers and travelers**, including Al-Idrisi and Ibn Battuta, both from northern Morocco.

**Muhammad Al-Idrisi** was born in Ceuta (Morocco) in 1099-1100 CE and studied in Cordoba, though he worked at the Norman court of Palermo. He traveled extensively through Asia Minor, Morocco, Spain, southern France, and even visited England. His descriptions of most of Western Europe and the Balkans were lively and accurate, although for other regions, he relied on existing writings. Al-Idrisi was an original geographer, creatively using a system of cylindrical projection of the Earth’s surface centuries before Gerard Mercator. His map also accurately placed the sources of the Nile in the equatorial highlands of Africa, a discovery often attributed to the 19th century. His major work, *Al-Kitab al-Rujari* (Roger’s book), also known as *Nuzhat al-mushtaq fi ikhtiraq al-afaq* (Pleasures of Men and Delights of Souls), was a large geographical encyclopedia that took him fifteen years to complete. This work, accompanied by a silver planisphere (now lost), is considered a "great monument of Arabic and Muslim geography".

**Ibn Battuta**, born in Tangier on February 24, 1304, embarked on his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1325 and returned to Morocco nearly 25 years later in 1349\. He then traveled to Spain, and extensively through the Mali Madinka state, including Timbuktu and Gao, returning to Morocco in 1354\. He dictated the story of his travels, known as *Rihla*, to Ibn Juzayy’, a scholar at the Merinid court in Fes. His *Rihla* provides unique information on 14th-century India, the Maldives, southern Russia, and Black Africa, detailing his experiences and observations. He described the Nile's unique rise during hot weather and the intensive cultivation along its banks. He noted the Turks' strict laws against theft and the exceptional skills of the Chinese, including their ability to draw accurate portraits of strangers, which amazed him.

Another notable geographer from the Islamic west, **Ali ibn Musa Ibn Sa’id al-Maghribi** (1213-1286), grew up in Marrakesh and was an indefatigable traveler. He authored *Kitab bast al-ardh* in 1250 and *Kitab al-jagrfiya*, which incorporated his extensive travels across the Muslim world, the Indian Ocean shores, and parts of northern Europe, including Iceland. His *Rayat al-mubarrizin wa-ghayat al-mumayyizin* (Banners of the Champions), written in 1243, is a well-known anthology of poetry. Ibn Sa’id's work included new information not found in Al-Idrisi, such as details about the Senegal River.

**Marrakech** was founded around 1070 by the Almoravids as their army headquarters and became the Almohad capital in 1147\. It attracted Maghribi scholars and some from Spain, becoming a center for power and knowledge. Ibn Rushd conducted astronomical observations there in 1153 and was associated with the Almohad court. The city was famous for the Kutubiya Mosque, known for its extensive libraries and bookshops, where numerous librarians and traders facilitated the copying and exchange of manuscripts. Marrakech also had a strong tradition of astrolabe constructors. Historians like Abu Bakr al-Sanhadji, who wrote extensively on the Almohads, flourished in Marrakech. Al-Murrakushi also penned his *Kitab al-Mu’jib* in Marrakech. The city's historical attractions include the walled Agdal Gardens, dating from Almohad times and irrigated by subterranean canals. One of the greatest accomplishments of Almohad rule was the Marrakech hospital, the Bimaristan of Amir al-Muminin al-Mansur abu Yusuf, which was described as unparalleled in the world for its extensive facilities, beautiful decorations, gardens, flowing water, and provision of comprehensive care for both rich and poor patients.

**Fes** is regarded as the spiritual capital of Morocco, renowned for its beauty and the expertise of Muslim art. Founded in the early 9th century by the Idrisids, Fes quickly grew, attracting people of diverse origins including Arabs, Berbers, Jews, and Andalusians. It became a strong center of scientific tradition and, under the Merinids, the political capital, attracting students from across the country to colleges and madrassas around the Qarawiyyin mosque.

The **Qarawiyyin mosque and university**, the city’s greatest intellectual claim, was first built in 859 CE by Fatima bint Muhammad al-Fihri. It is believed to have developed into a university during the Almoravid reign and became the principal center of higher learning in Morocco. Its body of scholars had a great impact on learning across the Mediterranean and Europe, with notable figures like Ibn Khaldun, Ibn al-Khatib, Al-Bitruji, and Leo Africanus studying and teaching there. The Qarawiyyin offered courses in grammar, rhetoric, logic, elements of mathematics, astronomy, and possibly history, geography, and chemistry. A contemporary chronicler highlighted Fes's richness and splendor during the Almohad reign, detailing its numerous mosques, zawiyas, public baths, mills, dwelling houses, warehouses, hotels, shops, workshops, tanneries, dye works, ovens, and notably, 400 paper-making shops.

Fes also housed remarkable **clocks**. One water-clock, made in 1286/87 by Ibn al-Habbak al-Tilimsani and restored in 1346-48, was located in the minaret of the Qarawiyyin Mosque. This clock, which incorporated an astrolabic rete that rotated once every 24 hours, imitated the apparent daily rotation of the heavens and dropped metal balls every hour. Another water-clock was constructed in the 14th century next to the Abu ‘Inaniyya Madrasa by Abu ‘l-Hasan Ibn Ali Ahmad al-Tilimsani, a *muwaqqit* (time keeper). This weight-powered water clock, inaugurated on May 6, 1357, had 12 windows and platforms with brass bowls, into which metal balls would fall hourly, chiming the time. The Abu ‘Inaniyya Madrasa itself, founded by the Marinid Sultan Abu Inan Faris, is a marvel of Marinid architecture and served as both an educational institute and a congregational mosque. These Fes clocks are the sole surviving Islamic examples of such astrolabic clocks, with similar designs described by Al-Jazari in the early 13th century.

Despite Morocco's rich heritage and significant contributions to Muslim civilization, few studies are devoted to it in English, particularly in electronic form. The intense academic interest in Islamic Spain often overshadows Morocco's intimately connected history and influence. There is a recognized need to present Morocco's scientific tradition, historical events, architecture, arts, education, mechanics, and engineering to an international audience.

Morocco was the **last North African country to establish a Pasteur Institute**, with institutes opening nearly two decades later than in Tunisia and Algeria. This delayed and duplicated establishment, with the first institute in Tangier in 1913 and a second in Casablanca in 1932, reflected significant challenges for Pastorians seeking a solid foothold in the country since the late 19th century. These issues stemmed from several factors, including a pre-existing Spanish-Moroccan bacteriological tradition, uncoordinated initiatives from Paris and Algiers, and the enduring solidity of the previously independent Moroccan state, which disrupted the French takeover. The failure of France to impose its colonial rule over the entire country, symbolized by Tangier's international regime, directly led to the need for a second center in Casablanca.

Before French Pastorianism gained traction, a modest bacteriological tradition had already taken root in Morocco, particularly in Tangier, driven by Sultan Hassan I's modernization efforts and Spanish imperial interests. From the mid-1880s, Spain sought to "regenerate Morocco" through public health initiatives. The International Sanitary Council of Tangier, established in 1840, was reformed and developed. In 1888, Doctor Severo Cenarro led the creation of a **Hygiene Commission**, promoting urban hygiene in Tangier and other port towns. Concurrently, Felipe Óvilo opened a **School of Medicine in Tangier in 1886**, which became a training center for Moroccan army doctors. These institutions fostered early bacteriological efforts, including research, vaccine/serum production, and disinfection, ensuring some Moroccan participation and benefit. For instance, Óvilo isolated the **Koch bacillus** in Tangier in September 1895 during a cholera epidemic. The Hygiene Commission also established a deposit of "cowpox lymph" by 1897 and anti-diphtheritic serum by 1898, which doctors Ramón Fiol and Samuel Mobily Güitta (a Moroccan-born, Spanish-naturalized Jew) successfully used. Disinfection procedures were also set up at the Mogador Island lazaretto by early 1896\.

When French bacteriology, associated with Louis Pasteur, arrived in Morocco in the mid-1890s as part of the Third Republic’s "civilizing mission," it encountered this existing local context. This meant Pastorianism, which typically thrived within a colonial health scheme like those in Algeria or Tonkin, was initially **forced to operate outside the local administration** in Morocco, constrained by the French Legation and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Initiatives originated from the distant Pasteur Institute of Paris (PIP) and Algiers (PIA), leading to a split between metropolitan and Algerian-oriented projects. These factors hindered Pastorian efforts, with competition often yielding unfavorable results against the established Spanish-Moroccan developments. For example, the PIP failed to monopolize the supply of anti-diphtheritic serum to the Hygiene Commission, which established its own local reserve by 1898\. Furthermore, in 1895, Dr. Henri Soulié, co-founder of the PIA, was sent to investigate a cholera epidemic but his findings, which aimed to absolve a French steamer, were discredited by Dr. Cenarro and publicly criticized by Óvilo.

After Spain's influence waned following the loss of Cuba and the Philippines in 1898, the situation shifted. Although Pastorians could not immediately deploy a unified colonial program, they gradually displaced Spanish doctors from prominent positions. For instance, French doctors, like Lucien Raynaud, health inspector of Algiers, were appointed to direct the pilgrims’ quarantine at Mogador Island from 1899, replacing the ousted Dr. Joaquín Cortés. By 1905, the PIP took over this task, with Dr. Maire appointed quarantine director until 1911\. Pastorian research also progressed, notably with Dr. Henri Foley, who, appointed by General Lyautey, established a "Saharan laboratory" in Beni-Ounif near Morocco’s Figuig oases in 1906\. Here, Foley conducted pioneering research on recurrent fever and tuberculosis affecting Eastern Moroccan populations, in collaboration with Edmond Sergent. His laboratory became an official branch of the PIA in 1909\.

The **creation of the Pasteur Institute of Tangier (PIT)** was greatly advanced by the intensification of French intervention in Morocco in the early 20th century. Secret agreements with Great Britain and Spain in 1902 and 1904 solidified French hegemony, further formalized by the Algeciras Conference of 1906\. By 1912, French troops had occupied key imperial cities, leading to the signing of a Protectorate Treaty in March 1912 and Lyautey’s appointment as Résident Général. This period spurred Pastorian initiatives, with Eugène Regnault, head of the Tangier Legation, advocating for a "model establishment" to study hygiene and secure French influence. The PIT was envisioned to unify Pastorian efforts and form the core of a new French-made health administration, under the authority of the French Legation and directed by an all-French commission. The primary motivation for its creation was the **growing threat of plague**, which escalated into a massive epidemic in the Dukkala region by 1911\. Regnault secured land and funding from the PIP and the French Home Office (Fonds des jeux), and architect Henri Saladin, with input from Émile Roux and Albert Calmette of the PIP, began construction in late 1910 or early 1911\. **Paul Remlinger**, an army bacteriologist turned Pastorian, was appointed director in July 1911 and immediately began studying the plague epidemic on the ground. The PIT started operations before construction was complete, replacing the French Hospital as a supplier of sera and opening its rabies vaccine section on May 25, 1913\. The institute was officially inaugurated on **July 14, 1913**, costing 300,000 francs for construction and equipment.

However, Remlinger immediately recognized a critical flaw: the **partition of Morocco into three zones**—a French Protectorate, a Spanish Protectorate, and an international Tangier—which had not been foreseen. This rendered the PIT legally trapped beyond French control and geographically isolated from French Morocco, undermining its intended role as a national institution. He stated that if this division had been known, Tangier would not have been chosen for the institute. Consequently, the PIT, despite being officially named *Institut Pasteur du Maroc* in 1914, was a purely French institution, its contract signed with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, not the French Protectorate. Its operations were supervised by a Paris-based *Comité de contrôle*, and the continued existence of Tangier's Sanitary Council and Hygiene Commission created obstacles to its autonomous development.

The new political landscape also prevented the PIT from subsuming the activities of Algerian-based Pastorians. Lyautey continued to support Foley's research on the Algerian-Moroccan border and sought to establish a new Pasteur institute in Rabat, the Protectorate's nascent capital. By 1913, Roux agreed to the concept of a "Pasteur Institute of Rabat". Lyautey aimed to integrate this institute within the Protectorate's health administration as the "keystone of a well-conceived Assistance Médicale Indigène". Although World War I brought a virtual shutdown to the PIT, with Remlinger and other army doctors mobilized, Lyautey created an *Institut Antirabique* (1915) and an *Institut Vaccinogène* (1913) in Rabat, which also included a *Laboratoire de Bactériologie*. These centers, largely products of the army's bacteriological tradition, were eventually brought under a unified administration in 1916\. Jules Colombani, promoted as the strongman of the Protectorate's public health, envisioned creating a "true Pasteur Institute in Casablanca" to concentrate treatment and research against epidemic diseases.

In the mid-1920s, a convergence of these disparate initiatives seemed possible. Remlinger worked to build ties between the PIT and the French Protectorate health administration, securing increased subventions and an assistant, Jacques Bailly. Land was purchased in Casablanca for the construction of a new *Institut Pasteur du Maroc*, planned to be adjacent to new civil, military, and native hospitals. This coincided with French ambitions to extend control over international Tangier and the Spanish Protectorate, including demands for Tangier's annexation at the Versailles Peace Conference. The Rif War (1921–1926) further destabilized the Spanish Protectorate, allowing France to advance its "pacification" efforts. However, Abdelkrim's offensive ultimately led to Lyautey's dismissal in July 1925 and the abandonment of French pan-Moroccan policies.

Remlinger's plans for a unified Moroccan Pasteur Institute then collapsed. He lamented the shift in policy, realizing that Colombani and his assistant, Dr. Maurice Gaud, intended to create a state-controlled Pasteur institute in Casablanca, largely independent of the PIP, serving primarily as a "useful laboratory" for vaccine production rather than a "big research institute". This vision materialized in the **Institut d’Hygiène du Maroc**, inaugurated in Rabat on **December 30, 1930**. This new institution, housed in a costly building designed by Pierre Bousquet and equipped with "first class" German instruments, was organized into numerous departments (Bacteriology, Pathological Anatomy, Parasitology, Malaria, etc.) and offered training courses. Despite its impressive facilities, it remained subordinate to the civil health administration, with Pastorians having no control.

The creation of the Rabat institute cemented the split of Pastorian projects in Morocco. The **Pasteur Institute of Casablanca (PIC)** was finally opened in **June 1932**, but largely as a subsidiary product of non-Moroccan North African Pastorianism. Edmond Sergent from the PIA drafted its contract, designed its building, and supervised its construction, with Georges Blanc, a disciple of the Tunis institute director Charles Nicolle, appointed as director. Though located in the French Protectorate, the PIC lacked real influence in health policies, primarily supplying BCG and smallpox vaccines and operating as an anti-rabies vaccination service. Its research program reflected ongoing lines from Algiers and Tunis rather than specific Moroccan pathologies.

Meanwhile, the Tangier Institute continued its "unstoppable decline". By April 1956, months before Morocco regained independence, a visiting researcher, Robert Neel, found the institute in a severe state of decay, its equipment outdated and buildings dilapidated. Paul Remlinger, the PIT's only director, remained in Tangier until his death in 1964, embodying France's diminishing influence in the city. The troubled early histories of both the Tangier and Casablanca Pasteur Institutes highlight that France's colonial hegemony in Morocco was less pervasive than often believed, forcing it to contend with a Spanish Protectorate and an international Tangier. Pastorianism, which required a purely French colonial environment to flourish, found this condition unfulfilled in Morocco, leading to its complex and fragmented development.

The Archives du Maroc, Morocco's new national archives, opened in 2013 in Rabat in a building previously constructed by the French to house the General Library. Its inauguration two years prior was hailed by the head of the Moroccan National Council for Human Rights as a vital institution for developing a "rational and pluralistic history". This institution's creation was mandated by law, following a strong recommendation from the **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)**, which operated from 2004 to 2005\.

The TRC investigated gross human rights violations, including forced disappearances, arbitrary detention, torture, sexual abuse, and coerced exile, that occurred between 1956 and the end of 1999 under the reign of King Hassan II. A significant impediment to the TRC's work was the "deplorable state of national archives". The lack of formal, organized archives, reliable records, and academic studies, coupled with limited access to written records from state ministries and police files, severely hampered its research and ability to collect evidence against perpetrators. This precarious documentation situation was a primary reason the TRC opted for a reconciliation framework rather than pursuing criminal charges. Consequently, the Committee often had to rely on **alternative forms of documentation**, such as prison memoirs, autobiographies, fictional texts, and even theatrical plays, to reconstruct events. The frustration among Committee members due to "archival silences," uncooperative officials, and "fragile" oral testimonies was evident. The Commission also faced challenges with a non-regulated legal framework and limited access to official records, including military archives, due to hesitations, slow delivery, or the short duration of its mandate.

The TRC prescribed the creation of a national archives to house its own records, viewing them as crucial for understanding its processes and for citizens to access a "hitherto hidden" part of the country's memory. It emphasized that such an institution was the "only institution that can ensure the protection and preservation of all national archival heritages". Slyomovics notes that the archives produced by the TRC's investigations are among its most significant contributions, providing "raw material for writing the history of Morocco" and narratives previously "out of the reach of many or forbidden and taboo". The Committee strongly recommended the opening of a formal National Archives, alongside other "institutional initiatives" like a new Master's degree in contemporary Moroccan history.

The 2011 inauguration of the Archives du Maroc was not the country's first attempt to establish a national archives; historically, the creation of archives and training of historians in Morocco have been "flawed processes". During the colonial era, French forces, after decades of ethnographic documentation, sought a centralized location for their records. This "Moroccan colonial archive," as termed by Burke, aimed to create an "objective record" of Moroccan life, customs, and laws, which ultimately served to justify the French protectorate. The modern Moroccan National Library (BNRM) evolved from earlier iterations, including the General Library of the Protectorate, conceived by French General Lyautey in 1919 as a "modern public library". The French deliberately used the term "general" instead of "national" to avoid "political sensitivities" related to colonialism. This general library incorporated collections from colonial research initiatives like the Institute of Advanced Moroccan Studies (IHEM) and private collections acquired or confiscated by the French. French legislation in 1926 and 1954 addressed state records management, but noncompliance was common.

Following independence in 1956, Moroccan intellectuals sought to redefine their national identity and history, moving away from colonial narratives. Despite the ruling elite often being historians and intellectuals, the establishment of a post-colonial national archives was significantly delayed, opening only in 2013\. This delay raises questions, especially since establishing a national archives was seen as a marker of a modern nation and postcolonial state development. One explanation is that Moroccan nationalists, rejecting the narratives of the colonial archive, focused instead on locating and collecting indigenous records to construct new post-colonial narratives. The existence of a French-established "national" library and archives from the 1920s might have also reduced the perceived urgency for another formal institution.

In this context, the **Hassan II Prize for Manuscripts and Archival Documents** was established in 1969 by the first post-colonial Ministry of Culture. This prize aimed to locate and preserve records held privately, incentivizing their disclosure through public recognition and cash rewards, thereby valorizing them as national documentary heritage. The Prize was an initiative of the Istiqlāl Party, led by Arab nationalists, and represented a "top-down custodial" attempt to "decolonise archives 'at the level of the source'". This program was part of a broader effort during a "particular historical moment when Morocco as a young independent nation was working to redefine what it meant to be Moroccan". It served as an **alternative post-colonial national archives**, supporting a master narrative of an Arab-Islamic identity for the country, in contrast to European colonial histories. Records submitted to the Prize, such as notarial documents, judicial advice, and learned people's notebooks, supported the narrative of an erudite nation connected to Andalusia and the Arab East. The Prize has received over 35,000 submissions, many of which have been microfilmed or digitized and stored at the National Library of Morocco (BNRM), with copies also kept at the new Archives du Maroc since 2015\. This focus on indigenous documents was reflected in the early 1970s, when the General Library's European language Moroccana became outdated, while Arabic materials were kept current.

The state of Moroccan documentary heritage was a significant concern at the inaugural 1966 colloquium of the Moroccan Historical Society, where a "national archives service" was deemed necessary for centralizing documents and training archivists. That same year, the Moroccan government invited **UNESCO** to appraise its archives and provide recommendations. In 1968, Yves Perotin of UNESCO visited Morocco, similar to a previous evaluation he conducted in Algeria. Over 82 days, Perotin surveyed the archival situation, noting the existence of "considerable importance" in private archival collections and observing "amicable steps" (likely referring to the nascent Hassan II Prize) to value them. His report provided a snapshot of post-colonial Moroccan archival collections, highlighting how some important local and regional records were jeopardized by restructuring during the final years of colonization and early independence. Perotin proposed modern reforms, including short-term preservation and archival training abroad, and long-term restructuring, emphasizing the development of a national team of specialists. Notably, the press conference announcing the Hassan II Prize occurred as Perotin was concluding his visit in February 1969\.

The Archives du Maroc, despite its late establishment, opened primarily with a **colonial fonds**, comprising records from the French colonial period (1912-1956). This Fonds Protectorat contains "management documents" related to the colonial economy, public works, and administrative or legislative matters that were not repatriated to France. The distinction between "management" and "sovereignty" records, conceived by French archivists, is considered arbitrary. The archives also hold files from the Direction des Affaires Indigènes and publications from other colonial projects, making it a "storehouse of the Moroccan colonial archive". This colonial archive, while a "formidable intellectual achievement," was "marked by the deforming lens of Orientalism" and used to justify the protectorate. The new national archives has been criticized for "seemingly accepting the colonial archive, its documentation methods, and the records it produced unquestionably," perpetuating colonial categories and units of analysis. This is exemplified by an exhibit on Henri de Castries, a French military officer and historian whose work, *The Unedited Sources on the History of Morocco*, aggregated documents from European libraries. While celebrated by some for his contributions to Moroccan history, Moroccan historian Germain Ayache criticized his reliance on European archives rather than actual Moroccan sources. Despite these issues, the opening of the Archives du Maroc, even with its colonial fonds, represents a breakthrough given that research on the colonial period was "off limits" until the late 1990s. These colonial documents, while revealing, must be critically examined to resist "ingesting it whole" without contemplation, as they provide clues that may extend beyond their architects' intentions. The "persistent significance of colonial-era representations" complicates the post-colonial struggle to define collective identities in Morocco.

Questions persist regarding the state and accessibility of post-colonial government records. The TRC found that a "part of the public and private archives was degraded" and that there was an "absence of a national modern institutional framework" for managing archives. While the new national archives aims to become a "true national archive" encompassing records from all state agencies, this is challenging due to a cultural lack of "archival responsibility" and a "disdain for the ‘paper trail’". Morocco is undergoing "archival and historical memory recovery," a process advanced by the TRC's mandate. However, the new national archives faces limitations due to the "unbalanced weight of colonial era records" and an inadequate budget, staff capacity, or physical space. The decades-long delay in its opening can be attributed to a lack of political will and the efforts of nationalist and post-colonial historians who sought to radically reshape historical narratives by prioritizing indigenous documents, as exemplified by the Hassan II Prize. Despite the current challenges, there is hope that pre-colonial and post-colonial collections will eventually move beyond the shadow of the colonial fonds to accurately represent the nation. Jamaâ Baida, the head of the Archives du Maroc, views the new institution as a "proof of concept" to raise public awareness about the importance of archives for healthy societies.

Morocco in the 16th century was a complex and fractured entity, characterized by the waning power of the **Wattasid dynasty**, largely confined to Fez, the powerful **Saadian empire** rising from the Sous region, and a significant **Portuguese presence on the Atlantic coast**. This tripartite division of power defines the historical context of the time. Amidst this, figures like Abdelkader l'Gharnati, a Moorish scholar who fled Granada in 1502, represent the influx of Andalusi refugees into Morocco following the fall of Granada in 1492 and the Spanish Inquisition. The period also saw Moroccan resistance against European influence. Challenges in Moroccan historiography, including distortions during the French occupation regarding women and Islamic aspects, and the importance of alternative national archives valuing local knowledge, provide nuance to understanding this era.

The city of **Mazagan** (modern-day El Jadida), located in the **Doukkala plains**, was a critical setting during this period. It was a **formidable, star-shaped Renaissance military fortress** built by an international team of engineers. Its **Manueline architectural style**, evident in civil and religious buildings like the Church of the Assumption and the famous subterranean cistern, provided distinct visual elements. Mazagan was perceived as a "self-contained, claustrophobic society, a tiny European island on a hostile African coast". Beyond Mazagan, other Doukkala cities like Azemmour showcased the Saadian "renaissance" style, emphasizing **intricate interior decoration, *zellij* tilework, carved stucco, cedarwood, *muqarnas*, and horseshoe arches**. Rural Doukkala featured diverse settlements, including traditional dry stone *Tazotas*, courtyard houses, and semi-nomadic tents, with the region known as an agricultural heartland growing wheat, olives, and sugar cane. Fez also held historical significance, notably with the **Al-Qarawiyyin mosque**.

The cultural immersion of 16th-century Morocco was rich in architectural artistry, including the use of **imported Italian Carrara marble** for elite Saadian buildings, intricately carved and painted **cedarwood**, fine **stucco (*geps*)**, and **vibrant mosaic tilework (*zellij*)**. Book arts from the Marinid and Wattasid periods (c. 1250-1550) featured **parchment and paper**—with Fez being a major center for paper mills—along with Maghrebi calligraphy and distinct **Morocco leather bindings with geometric interlace patterns**, often incorporating eight-pointed stars and central medallions. Music genres such as **Malhun and Tarab al-Andalusi**, as well as **Chaabi and Aita**, were prominent. The **Aicha Kandicha legend** and Sufi practices provided unique folklore elements. Elite fashion included the **kaftan, takchita, and mansouria**, made from luxurious fabrics like silk brocade, velvet, or imported "Brown Blues" woolen cloth, while the traditional *haik* represented common attire. Daily life revolved around local markets (*souqs*) with specialized artisan guilds, the importance of trans-Saharan trade routes for **gold and salt**, and agricultural products like sugar cane.

Military and conflict dynamics were central to 16th-century Morocco. The **Portuguese garrison's evolution in arms and armor** included Renaissance-era pikemen and arquebusiers, with their military doctrine involving siegecraft, fortress defense, and asymmetrical warfare tactics known as *cavalgadas* and *salto*. The Saadian army, in contrast, employed a mix of **traditional mobile cavalry** and **professional infantry armed with modern arquebuses and Turkish weaponry**, demonstrating a "reciprocal evolution" where both sides adapted to each other's strengths. Portuguese fleets were crucial for sustaining Mazagan, and corsair vessels like **galiots** and **fustas** were used for raiding, suggesting potential naval conflicts.

Morocco's identity has deep roots, with human habitation spanning the Lower Paleolithic period, evidenced by the oldest known *Homo sapiens* fossils (300,000 years old) at Jebel Irhoud. Early cultural expressions include 82,000-year-old perforated seashell beads found in Taforalt, the earliest known personal adornment. The indigenous **Amazigh communities** have a sophisticated visual language, notably in tattooing (*oucham*, *tichrad*, or *tagezzayt*), a non-literate system of communication, cultural memory, and expression of identity and spirituality. Amazigh tattoo motifs are linked to Neolithic rock art from the Capsian period (7500–4000 BC), suggesting an ancestral connection to the Libyco-Berber alphabet, Tifinagh. Moroccan identity is a tapestry of Arab, Amazigh, and European influences, with historical studies, such as Abdallah Laroui's *History of the Maghrib*, emphasizing the importance of understanding long-term continuities beyond dynastic or conqueror-centric narratives.

The evolution of the Moroccan state is marked by successive dynasties and external pressures. After the Muslim conquest in the early 8th century, the **Berber Revolt of 740 CE** led to Morocco breaking away from the Umayyad Caliphate. The **Barghawata**, a Masmuda Berber confederation, established an independent state (744-1058 CE) in Tamesna, near the Atlantic coast. Their distinct, syncretic religion, including a Berber Quran and a God named *Yakouch*, was viewed as heretical, leading to "holy war against them". Despite this, their military aptitude and strategic position allowed them to resist for three centuries before being eliminated by the Almohads in 1149\. The **Idrisid dynasty** (789-974), founded by Idris I (an Arab who married a Berber and lived among the Ourabas), established the first Moroccan state. Fez, founded by Idris II, became their capital and a significant religious center.

Later, the **Almoravids** (c. 1060-1147) and **Almohads** (c. 1121-1269) formed successive Berber empires that reunified Morocco and projected power into Al-Andalus. The Almoravids intervened in Spain in 1086, defeating Christian forces at Zallaqa and eventually establishing rule over Muslim Spain, halting the Castilian advance and allowing Muslim civilization to prosper \[History, Culture and Science in Morocco: 11th-14th Centuries \- Muslim Heritage\]. They are sometimes historically misrepresented as "savages" despite their significant cultural evolution and unification of Spain and Northwest Africa \[History, Culture and Science in Morocco: 11th-14th Centuries \- Muslim Heritage\]. The Almohads, founded by Ibn Tumart, a Masmuda Berber scholar and self-proclaimed Mahdi, preached "absolute divine unity (*Tawhid*)" and launched a holy war against the Almoravids. Their empire became "the largest ever to be ruled from Morocco," extending across the Maghreb and Muslim al-Andalus. They were known for cultural achievements, including the construction of the Kutubiya Mosque in Marrakech and the Giralda in Seville (which also served as an observatory), and fostering scholars like Ibn Rushd \[History, Culture and Science in Morocco: 11th-14th Centuries \- Muslim Heritage\]. However, Almohad rule declined after the decisive Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, which marked "the beginning of the end of Muslim Spain" \[9, History, Culture and Science in Morocco: 11th-14th Centuries \- Muslim Heritage\].

The **Marinid dynasty** (c. 1244-1465) established the *madrasa* system in Morocco to centralize power and create a loyal elite. The **Wattasid dynasty** (c. 1472-1554) followed, but saw their power decline amidst internal strife and European incursions. The **Saadian dynasty** (1549-1659), claiming Sharifian lineage, rose by leading a *jihad* against Portuguese enclaves. They were military innovators, embracing gunpowder technology, professionalizing their army, and maintaining Moroccan sovereignty against the Ottoman threat, which was "fundamental in forging a distinct and fiercely independent Moroccan national identity". The Battle of the Three Kings (1578) was a pivotal victory against Portugal, enriching Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur and boosting his legitimacy. The current ruling dynasty, the **Alaouites** (since 1666), maintained a distinction between *Bled el-Makhzen* (direct governmental control) and *Bled es-Siba* (autonomous tribal regions) until the 20th century.

The 19th and 20th centuries saw increasing European influence, leading to French and Spanish protectorates. The French Protectorate (established 1912\) implemented policies to divide Arab and Berber populations, which was met with resistance. The Berber Dahir of 1930, aiming to codify customary law in Berber areas instead of Sharia, sparked a massive nationalist protest, uniting Moroccans against colonial policies. Sultan Muhammad V supported the nationalist movement, culminating in Morocco gaining independence from France in 1956 and Spain in 1956\. Post-independence, challenges include an "executive monarchy" where the king holds significant prerogatives, economic disparities benefiting a wealthy minority, and human rights concerns regarding freedom of expression and arbitrary detention. The **Western Sahara conflict**, ongoing since 1975, involves the Polisario Front and Morocco, with the UN affirming the Sahrawi people's right to self-determination, while Morocco advocates for autonomy under its sovereignty. Debates on cultural identity continue regarding the role of Arabic, Amazigh (which was incorporated into the constitution in 2011), and foreign languages.

Morocco has been a vibrant center of intellectual, artistic, and scientific endeavors. Cities like Fez and Marrakech were major learning hubs, with the **Qarawiyyin mosque in Fez**, established in the 9th century, depicted as the "oldest college in the world". Marinid *madrasas* (e.g., Bou Inania, Al-Attarine in Fez) are masterpieces of Hispano-Moorish style. Notable scholars and travelers include **Ibn Battuta** (d. 1369), whose *Rihla* details his extensive journeys; **Al-Idrisi** (d. 1166), a renowned geographer who created a scientifically accurate silver planisphere; **Ibn al-Banna** (d. 1321), a great mathematician and astronomer; and **Ibn Khaldun** (d. 1406), whose *al-Muqaddimah* laid foundations of sociology and philosophy of history \[12, History, Culture and Science in Morocco: 11th-14th Centuries \- Muslim Heritage\]. Marinid-era Moroccan books were known for their robust bindings, iron-gall ink, Maghrebi scripts, and intricate geometric and arabesque patterns. Architectural heritage includes Almohad minarets (Giralda, Kutubiyya, Hassân Tower) and Marinid *madrasas*. **The Atlas Lion** is a powerful symbol of strength and royalty, while **Aicha Kandicha** is a prominent jinn-like mythological figure, possibly linked to historical resistance against the Portuguese. Oral traditions like Sufi poetry and folk tales were crucial for expression and knowledge transmission, particularly for women.

Morocco's economy and military history reflect strategic resource management and adaptation to warfare technologies. The Barb horse was essential for Saadian cavalry, and the Dromedary camel was crucial for trans-Saharan transport and projecting military power. The Saadian dynasty revolutionized Moroccan warfare by establishing a professional, standing army, embracing gunpowder technology (including domestically produced cannons), and employing sophisticated combined-arms tactics. Early Portuguese incursions had highlighted Moroccan military weaknesses, attributed to the "weakness and sloth of the Wattasid sultan" against superior Portuguese artillery. Moroccan markets (*souqs*) were vital hubs for trade, with Portuguese enclaves like Mazagan creating a complex environment where official hostility coexisted with pragmatic, unofficial trade. The Saadians monopolized sugar exports and taxed trans-Saharan trade to fund military campaigns, also seeking trade relations with European powers for firearms. In the mid-16th century, both Wattasid and Saadian dynasties minted their own currencies (silver *dirham*, copper *falus*), alongside Portuguese *réis* and Spanish coins. In the 19th century, Moroccan sultans increasingly relied on European loans, leading to economic capture by European finance.

This study investigates how a pre-modern Moroccan nation is constructed in middle school social studies textbooks, focusing on the cultural symbols used to form this national identity. Using an ethno-symbolist conceptual framework developed by Anthony Smith, the research highlights the significant role of textbooks in nation-building. The study suggests that these textbooks construct a pre-modern nation of Morocco primarily out of an Arab-Muslim cultural repertoire. Given Morocco's recent political changes, including the 2011 constitution that recognized the nation's multicultural nature, the article aims to assess whether this multicultural spirit is reflected in the textbooks. The research recommends changes to textbook content to adopt a multicultural approach that accommodates the cultural contributions of Amazigh and Jewish ethnic groups in national narratives.

Anthony Smith's ethno-symbolist approach to nation formation defines a nation as a "named and self-defining human community whose members cultivate shared memories, symbols, myths, traditions, and values, inhabit and are attached to historic territories or 'homelands,' create and disseminate a distinctive public culture, and observe shared customs and standardized laws". This framework allows for the emergence of nations centuries before the 18th century, which is relevant as Moroccan school textbooks refer to the establishment of the first Moroccan state in the 8th century. Smith proposes five social processes for a community to be forged into a nation: self-definition (through myths of ancestry), myth and memory cultivation (through myths of election), territorialization (through the sanctification of a homeland), creating a distinctive public culture (through language and religion), and creating shared customs and standardized laws. Nations are believed to be created over a long duration and have ethnic origins, progressing through phases from ethnie to pre-modern nation to modern nation.

The decisive role of education in nation-building is emphasized in nationalism studies. Scholars like Renan highlight the importance of collective memory, Gellner stresses cultural standardization for societal transitions, and Smith points to educational institutions for creating national narratives. Anderson, defining nations as "imagined communities," believes print-capitalism, including books and textbooks, plays a significant role in unifying national communities. International research supports the link between school textbooks and national construction; for instance, Jordanian history textbooks use exclusion strategies to build national identity, Bulgarian primary school textbooks portray an ethnically homogenous Christian nation, and Iranian middle school history textbooks make Islam the most prominent element of national identity. In Morocco, previous research on history textbooks has shown an evolution from Arabization of national identity (first generation) to incorporating Amazigh history and a non-Arab perception of Islamic history (later generations). One study found that national identity discourse in Moroccan textbooks does not adopt a pan-Arabism stance and depicts Amazigh people as defenders who helped create the first Moroccan Islamic state. However, another study analyzing French textbooks found a weak discourse on national identity, with Islamic education textbooks regarding Muslim religious identity as the basis for all other identities.

This study specifically analyzed second-year middle school social studies textbooks: *Annajah Fi Al Ijtimaiayte*, *Faddaa Al Ijtimaiyate*, and *Manar Al Ijtimaiyate*, all approved by the Moroccan Ministry of Education and covering the pre-modern era. The analysis used a qualitative, and to a lesser extent quantitative, approach to identify cultural symbols and their corresponding nation-formation processes.

**The Process of Self-Definition:** The textbooks narrate genealogical ties to Prophet Muhammad, or a "myth of ancestry," for the ruling elites of certain dynasties, thereby self-defining pre-modern Morocco as an Arabo-Islamic nation. This myth is strongly stressed for the Idrissid, Saadi, and Alaouite dynasties, which are portrayed as *Ashraf* (descendants of the Prophet) and originating from Arabia (Alhijaz). The Idrissids are introduced as descendants of Ali Ben Abi Talib, the Prophet's son-in-law. The Saadis are defined as *Ashraf* from the prophetic house. The Alaouites are traced back to Hassan Ben Alkacem, brought from Alhijaz, and are explicitly stated to be "offspring of Fatima, the daughter of prophet Muhammad" and Ali Bin Abi Talib. This consistent narration of an Arab ethnic origin and prophetic blood ties serves as a permanent cultural feature symbolizing the nation's genesis and persistence, fusing religion with ethnicity to define Morocco as an Arab-Muslim nation. In contrast, the Almoravid and Merinid dynasties, noted to be of Amazigh origin, are not ascribed this myth of common ancestry. While the Almohad leader, Ibn Tumart, is mentioned as having genealogical ties to Hassan Bin Ali Bin Abi Talib, two textbooks cast doubt on this by stressing his claim to be the Mahdi, which could undermine his credibility.

**The Process of Myth and Memory Cultivation:** The textbooks present the "pledge of allegiance" (Al Bayaa) as a "myth of missionary election," cultivating memory necessary for the genesis of the nation. Al Bayaa, defined as an Islamic concept going back to Prophet Muhammad's era, is a contract between the pledge makers and the appointee (Sultan, Khalifa, or king) to manage public affairs based on Islamic teachings, implying a mission to implement Islamic law. This concept is omnipresent throughout the pre-modern era, marking the genesis and persistence of the nation through various ruling states. The frequency of using Al Bayaa-related words is highest for the Idrissid and Alaouite states, indicating the nation's continuity from the first to the last dynasties. The emphasis on Al Bayaa during the Idrissid dynasty highlights the birth of the nation and the religious unity between Arab and Amazigh groups.

**The Process of Territorialization:** The textbooks sanctify Fez as a "sacred homeland" for the pre-modern Moroccan nation, prioritizing it over other historical cities like Marrakech. This is achieved by narrating its foundation by the "noble" Idriss II, son of Idriss I (who had prophetic blood ties), and by highlighting the holiness of its religious center, Al Qarawiyyin. Idriss II is referred to as "Imam Idriss" and "Maoula," lending him sacred ethno-religious legitimacy and making Fez a place of saint-hood activities. The Al Qarawiyyin mosque, depicted as the "oldest college in the world" and older than Al Azhar University in Egypt, is presented as the nation's religious center. Its foundation by Fatima Al Fihriya during Ramadan is portrayed as a sacred act, helping to set boundaries between pre-modern Morocco as an independent nation and the rest of the Islamic world.

**The Process of Creating a Distinctive Public Culture:** Islam is cultivated in the textbooks to generate a typical public culture for pre-modern Morocco, with Friday prayer and the pledge of allegiance serving as primary cultural symbols, especially during the Idrissid dynasty. The weekly Friday prayer (Salat Aljumuaah) symbolizes communal gathering and a sacred union between the Imam (Idriss I) and his subjects through the sermon. The pledge of allegiance, besides providing a myth of missionary election, also functions as a public ritual held during changes in state leadership, fostering a communion between rulers and their people based on a contract to uphold Islamic law.

**The Process of Creating Shared Customs and Standardized Laws:** The textbooks depict both the state and religious institutions as guardians of shared customs and standardized laws in pre-modern Morocco. Dynasties like the Idrissids, Almoravids, Almohads, Merinids, Saadis, and Alaouites are consistently labeled as "states" (Addawla), forming a historical continuity of the Moroccan state, unlike the Barghawata dynasty. These states, established through the concept of Al Bayaa, ensure the observance of shared customs and standardized laws, framed within Islamic teachings, including Sharia Law. For example, Yusuf Ben Tashfine (Almoravid leader) is noted for imposing only religiously sanctioned taxes like Zakat, which is significant for defining the Muslim community and fostering fraternity. The religious institution of Islam thus plays a vital role by endowing rulers with sacred laws to enforce. Additionally, state leaders like Mly Suleiman (Alaouite dynasty) imposed restrictions supported by *Fukaha* (Muslim scholars) who issued *Fatwas*, strengthening the Sultan's power to enforce laws on the community.

In conclusion, the analysis of middle school social studies textbooks reveals that the pre-modern Moroccan nation is constructed over a long period based on dominant Arab-Muslim cultural resources. This construction involves the processes of self-definition, myth and memory cultivation, territorialization, creating a distinctive public culture, and establishing shared customs and standardized laws. The cultural symbols employed include Arab ancestry ties to Prophet Muhammad, the pledge of allegiance (Al Bayaa), Fez as the sacred homeland, and the Islamic religion. This portrayal highlights the ethno-religious character of pre-modern Morocco as an Arab-Muslim nation. The study recommends that textbooks adopt a multicultural approach to accommodate the cultural symbols of Amazigh and Jewish ethnic groups, aligning with Morocco's 2011 constitutional reforms promoting national identity pluralism.

This study investigates how a pre-modern Moroccan nation is constructed in middle school social studies textbooks, focusing on the cultural symbols used to form this national identity. Using an ethno-symbolist conceptual framework developed by Anthony Smith, the research highlights the significant role of textbooks in nation-building. The study suggests that these textbooks construct a pre-modern nation of Morocco primarily out of an Arab-Muslim cultural repertoire. Given Morocco's recent political changes, including the 2011 constitution that recognized the nation's multicultural nature, the article aims to assess whether this multicultural spirit is reflected in the textbooks. The research recommends changes to textbook content to adopt a multicultural approach that accommodates the cultural contributions of Amazigh and Jewish ethnic groups in national narratives.

Anthony Smith's ethno-symbolist approach to nation formation defines a nation as a "named and self-defining human community whose members cultivate shared memories, symbols, myths, traditions, and values, inhabit and are attached to historic territories or 'homelands,' create and disseminate a distinctive public culture, and observe shared customs and standardized laws". This framework allows for the emergence of nations centuries before the 18th century, which is relevant as Moroccan school textbooks refer to the establishment of the first Moroccan state in the 8th century. Smith proposes five social processes for a community to be forged into a nation: self-definition (through myths of ancestry), myth and memory cultivation (through myths of election), territorialization (through the sanctification of a homeland), creating a distinctive public culture (through language and religion), and creating shared customs and standardized laws. Nations are believed to be created over a long duration and have ethnic origins, progressing through phases from ethnie to pre-modern nation to modern nation.

The decisive role of education in nation-building is emphasized in nationalism studies. Scholars like Renan highlight the importance of collective memory, Gellner stresses cultural standardization for societal transitions, and Smith points to educational institutions for creating national narratives. Anderson, defining nations as "imagined communities," believes print-capitalism, including books and textbooks, plays a significant role in unifying national communities. International research supports the link between school textbooks and national construction; for instance, Jordanian history textbooks use exclusion strategies to build national identity, Bulgarian primary school textbooks portray an ethnically homogenous Christian nation, and Iranian middle school history textbooks make Islam the most prominent element of national identity. In Morocco, previous research on history textbooks has shown an evolution from Arabization of national identity (first generation) to incorporating Amazigh history and a non-Arab perception of Islamic history (later generations). One study found that national identity discourse in Moroccan textbooks does not adopt a pan-Arabism stance and depicts Amazigh people as defenders who helped create the first Moroccan Islamic state. However, another study analyzing French textbooks found a weak discourse on national identity, with Islamic education textbooks regarding Muslim religious identity as the basis for all other identities.

This study specifically analyzed second-year middle school social studies textbooks: *Annajah Fi Al Ijtimaiayte*, *Faddaa Al Ijtimaiyate*, and *Manar Al Ijtimaiyate*, all approved by the Moroccan Ministry of Education and covering the pre-modern era. The analysis used a qualitative, and to a lesser extent quantitative, approach to identify cultural symbols and their corresponding nation-formation processes.

**The Process of Self-Definition:** The textbooks narrate genealogical ties to Prophet Muhammad, or a "myth of ancestry," for the ruling elites of certain dynasties, thereby self-defining pre-modern Morocco as an Arabo-Islamic nation. This myth is strongly stressed for the Idrissid, Saadi, and Alaouite dynasties, which are portrayed as *Ashraf* (descendants of the Prophet) and originating from Arabia (Alhijaz). The Idrissids are introduced as descendants of Ali Ben Abi Talib, the Prophet's son-in-law. The Saadis are defined as *Ashraf* from the prophetic house. The Alaouites are traced back to Hassan Ben Alkacem, brought from Alhijaz, and are explicitly stated to be "offspring of Fatima, the daughter of prophet Muhammad" and Ali Bin Abi Talib. This consistent narration of an Arab ethnic origin and prophetic blood ties serves as a permanent cultural feature symbolizing the nation's genesis and persistence, fusing religion with ethnicity to define Morocco as an Arab-Muslim nation. In contrast, the Almoravid and Merinid dynasties, noted to be of Amazigh origin, are not ascribed this myth of common ancestry. While the Almohad leader, Ibn Tumart, is mentioned as having genealogical ties to Hassan Bin Ali Bin Abi Talib, two textbooks cast doubt on this by stressing his claim to be the Mahdi, which could undermine his credibility.

**The Process of Myth and Memory Cultivation:** The textbooks present the "pledge of allegiance" (Al Bayaa) as a "myth of missionary election," cultivating memory necessary for the genesis of the nation. Al Bayaa, defined as an Islamic concept going back to Prophet Muhammad's era, is a contract between the pledge makers and the appointee (Sultan, Khalifa, or king) to manage public affairs based on Islamic teachings, implying a mission to implement Islamic law. This concept is omnipresent throughout the pre-modern era, marking the genesis and persistence of the nation through various ruling states. The frequency of using Al Bayaa-related words is highest for the Idrissid and Alaouite states, indicating the nation's continuity from the first to the last dynasties. The emphasis on Al Bayaa during the Idrissid dynasty highlights the birth of the nation and the religious unity between Arab and Amazigh groups.

**The Process of Territorialization:** The textbooks sanctify Fez as a "sacred homeland" for the pre-modern Moroccan nation, prioritizing it over other historical cities like Marrakech. This is achieved by narrating its foundation by the "noble" Idriss II, son of Idriss I (who had prophetic blood ties), and by highlighting the holiness of its religious center, Al Qarawiyyin. Idriss II is referred to as "Imam Idriss" and "Maoula," lending him sacred ethno-religious legitimacy and making Fez a place of saint-hood activities. The Al Qarawiyyin mosque, depicted as the "oldest college in the world" and older than Al Azhar University in Egypt, is presented as the nation's religious center. Its foundation by Fatima Al Fihriya during Ramadan is portrayed as a sacred act, helping to set boundaries between pre-modern Morocco as an independent nation and the rest of the Islamic world.

**The Process of Creating a Distinctive Public Culture:** Islam is cultivated in the textbooks to generate a typical public culture for pre-modern Morocco, with Friday prayer and the pledge of allegiance serving as primary cultural symbols, especially during the Idrissid dynasty. The weekly Friday prayer (Salat Aljumuaah) symbolizes communal gathering and a sacred union between the Imam (Idriss I) and his subjects through the sermon. The pledge of allegiance, besides providing a myth of missionary election, also functions as a public ritual held during changes in state leadership, fostering a communion between rulers and their people based on a contract to uphold Islamic law.

**The Process of Creating Shared Customs and Standardized Laws:** The textbooks depict both the state and religious institutions as guardians of shared customs and standardized laws in pre-modern Morocco. Dynasties like the Idrissids, Almoravids, Almohads, Merinids, Saadis, and Alaouites are consistently labeled as "states" (Addawla), forming a historical continuity of the Moroccan state, unlike the Barghawata dynasty. These states, established through the concept of Al Bayaa, ensure the observance of shared customs and standardized laws, framed within Islamic teachings, including Sharia Law. For example, Yusuf Ben Tashfine (Almoravid leader) is noted for imposing only religiously sanctioned taxes like Zakat, which is significant for defining the Muslim community and fostering fraternity. The religious institution of Islam thus plays a vital role by endowing rulers with sacred laws to enforce. Additionally, state leaders like Mly Suleiman (Alaouite dynasty) imposed restrictions supported by *Fukaha* (Muslim scholars) who issued *Fatwas*, strengthening the Sultan's power to enforce laws on the community.

The Barghawatas were a Berber tribal confederation belonging to the Masmuda division, inhabiting the Atlantic coast of Morocco in the Tamesna region, located between Safi and Salé, an area that today includes Casablanca and Rabat. They established a powerful, independent Berber state from 744 to 1058 CE, which was characterized by its own distinct religion and a formidable army. Despite their significant political role in North Africa until the arrival of the Almoravids in the second half of the 11th century, medieval Arabic history often depicted them with increasing ambivalence due to their unique religious practices, ultimately vilifying and condemning them. Some historians, like Jérôme Carcopino, suggest the name "Barghawata" might derive from the ancient Roman Baquates tribe near Volubilis, while others believe it's a phonetic deformation of "Barbati," a nickname for their leader Tarif, who might have been born near Barbate, Spain.

The Barghawatas played a crucial role in the Berber Revolt of 739 or 740 CE, allying with other Amazigh groups like the Ghomara and Miknasa against the ruling Umayyad Caliphate. This revolt was fueled by Sufri Kharijite preachers who advocated for total egalitarianism in opposition to the Umayyad aristocracy, and by the Umayyads' mistreatment of non-Arab Muslims, including heavy taxation and enslavement. Led by Maysara al-Matghari, the rebels successfully took control of most of present-day Morocco. Key victories included the Battle of the Nobles (Ghazwat al-Ashraf) in December 740 CE near Tangier, where many Arab aristocrats were massacred, and the Battle of Bagdoura in late 741 CE near Fes, which annihilated a powerful Syrian army and permanently broke the Umayyad grip on the far west Maghreb. The Barghawatas, as founders of the revolt, became resentful when later adherents, particularly Zenata chieftains and authoritarian Sufri commissars, attempted to control the rebellion's leadership. Having achieved their primary objective of liberation from Umayyad rule, they saw no reason to continue military campaigns. In 742 or 743 CE, they withdrew from the rebel alliance, retreated to the Tamesna region, and founded their new independent state, abandoning Sufri Kharijitism. This cultural rebellion, expressed through a distinct Berber Islam, complemented their successful political liberation from the Arabo-Islamic order.

The Barghawata state was led by a succession of rulers. **Tarif al-Matghari** was the ancestor of its rulers and likely a Kharijite. His son, **Ṣāliḥ ibn Tarif** (744-?), declared himself a prophet in 744 CE, leaving at the age of 47 with a promise to return. He is believed to have introduced a Berber Quran. **Ilias ibn Salih** (792-842 CE) succeeded him, publicly professing Islam while secretly following Ṣāliḥ's religion, and reigned for 50 years. **Younes ibn Ilias** (842-888 CE or 842-884 CE) formalized Salih's religion, notably undertaking a "radical Berberization of Islam" and executing those who refused to convert, reportedly killing 7,770 people. Younes, a calculating and charismatic leader, is sometimes credited with inventing this religion himself and attributing it to his respected grandfather to gain legitimacy. He is thought to have returned from a journey to the East with a new religious zeal and disdain for orthodox Islam, perceiving it as representing Arab rather than Amazigh identity. **Abou Ghafir Mohammed** (888-917 CE) was also called a prophet and died in the 29th year of his reign. **Abou an-Ansar Abdoullah** (917-961 CE) was buried in Ameslakht and died in the 44th year of his reign. **Abou Mansour Isa** (961-?) became king at 22\. Later, **Abu Hafs Abdullah** is mentioned in Arabic sources as an emir who fought against the Almoravids, leading to the death of their spiritual leader, Abdallah ibn Yasin, in 1058 CE.

The Barghawatas developed a distinctive **syncretic religion**, often referred to as Berber Islam, which was a "cultural rebellion" against Arab dominance. It was not a complete rejection of Islam, but rather a reinterpretation that aimed to contextualize the faith within the Amazigh milieu and assert their ethnic and cultural identity. This religion incorporated elements of Sunni, Shi'a, and Kharijite Islam, mixed with astrological and traditional Berber beliefs. They had their own **Berber Quran** of 80 suras, some of which were translations of the Arabic Quran, while others were unique, named after prophets like Salih and Younes. The Berber Quran considered the word of God (Yakouch) to be revealed to Salih ibn Tarif, making Salih the prophet of the Berbers (*waryawari* – "one after whom no other prophet will come"), while Mohammed was recognized as the prophet of the Arabs. Their God was called **Yakouch**, not Allah. Specific practices included demanding ten daily prayers (compared to five in orthodox Islam), reducing the Ramadan fast to three days, and praying according to the cock crow rather than a fixed solar schedule. They also observed a taboo on eating eggs and chickens and believed in the *baraka* (blessedness) of the prophet Salih's saliva. These specific adaptations, which sometimes aligned with "magic" or pre-Islamic Berber traditions, served to affirm their ethnic identity and elevate Berber figures to religious prominence, counteracting the dominant Arabo-Islamic social order.

The longevity of the Barghawata dynasty for over three centuries (744-1058 CE) was attributed to several factors beyond their unique religion. They possessed a **redoubtable and well-structured army** capable of fielding over 12,000 cavalry, as reported by al-Bakri. Their military prowess was renowned, and they were led by cunning, intelligent, charismatic, and often ruthless rulers. Rulers like Younes ibn Ilias used military force to maintain order and prevent dissidence, while Abdallah Abou an-Ansar managed relations with neighboring tribes by annually assembling his army to threaten raids, securing gifts and promises of friendship. Geographically, their location on the Atlantic coast with a friendly Al-Andalus meant they could focus defenses on land borders. Their territory's complex topography with winding river valleys made invasion difficult, and fertile soil allowed for self-sufficiency, minimizing reliance on surrounding kingdoms. They also effectively used fire signals and local rivers for communication, giving them an advantage over invading forces. These combined strengths allowed them to resist external pressures from the Idrisids and Umayyads for generations.

The Barghawatas initially maintained good relations with the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordoba, but these relations broke down by the end of the 10th century. They successfully repelled two Umayyad incursions from Spain (977-978; 998-999) and a Fatimid attack from the East (982-983). From the 11th century, they engaged in intense guerrilla warfare with their Amazigh neighbors, the Banou Ifrens, which weakened them. Despite this, they famously repelled attacks from the rising Almoravids, even causing the death of the Almoravid spiritual leader, Abdallah ibn Yasin, in battle in 1058 CE. However, the Barghawatas were ultimately eliminated as a political and religious group by the **Almohads** in 1149 CE. The Almohad military leader Abdelmoumen conquered the Barghawata principality and "totally exterminated its 'heretical' population". The Tamesna region was then isolated for several decades before the Almohads resettled it with Arab tribes as a punitive measure.

Historically, the Barghawata dynasty remains controversial and is often marginalized in Moroccan history, frequently being incomplete or absent from school curricula. Their distinct religious doctrine, considered heterodox by orthodox Islam, led neighboring dynasties like the Idrisids, Zirids, Almoravids, and Almohads to declare holy war against them. Despite this, their history is crucial for understanding the contemporary Amazigh identity, as they asserted a platform of *Amazighitude*—the idea that the indigenous population should be politically and culturally liberated from foreign influence. Their resistance challenged the common perception that North African Berbers passively accepted Arab rule and Islam, instead demonstrating a determination to adapt Islam to their own cultural context. Modern Moroccan deviations from orthodox Muslim practices, such as the veneration of saints (maraboutism), are seen by some as a continuation of this persistent Amazigh determination to practice Islam in their own way.

After the death of Idris II in 828 CE, the Idrissid state in Morocco fractured, with his sons dividing the region into numerous semi-independent principalities, such as Fes, Taza, and Basra. This political fragmentation left Morocco vulnerable to external influence, transforming it into a "chessboard" where two major powers, the Fatimids from Ifriqiya (modern-day Tunisia) and the Umayyads of al-Andalus (Córdoba), vied for control. Both dynasties sought to exert influence over Morocco by utilizing vassals, governors, and client dynasties, leading to a period where tribes, cities, and local rulers constantly shifted their allegiance based on who offered the most protection or financial incentives.

Several key players emerged as "middlemen" or instruments for the Fatimids and Umayyads. By the 10th century, the **Idrissids** themselves were reduced to minor rulers in Fes and its environs, often switching sides. Some Idrissid emirs, due to their descent from Ahl al-Bayt and a Shi‘i affinity, pledged loyalty to the Fatimids, while others allied with the Umayyads to resist Fatimid pressure. An example is al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Qasim, an Idrissid of Fes, who was recognized by Córdoba in 931 but later compelled to submit to the Fatimids. The **Miknasa**, a powerful Zenata Berber tribe in central and northern Morocco, were significant "swing men" of the era. Their chief, Musa ibn Abi’l-‘Afiya (d. \~938), initially served as a Fatimid vassal, even receiving the title of *amir al-Maghrib*, before defecting to the Umayyads of Córdoba around 931–932. He eventually attempted to establish an independent rule, but his ambitions were ultimately crushed by shifting alliances.

The **Maghrawa**, another Zenata Berber group from the Middle Atlas and Fes, rose in power during the Idrissid decline. Their leaders, such as Muhammad ibn Khazar al-Maghrawi, allied firmly with the Umayyads and became Córdoba’s primary clients in Morocco, eventually ruling Fes under Umayyad suzerainty. The **Barghawata**, an independent and "heretical" state on the Tamesna coast (744–1058), also played both sides opportunistically. Although they became a significant regional force by the mid-10th century, their religious isolation meant neither the Fatimids nor the Umayyads fully trusted them. Other Zenata confederations, including the Hawwāra and Banū Ifran in present-day Algeria and eastern Morocco, similarly shifted between Fatimid and Umayyad patronage.

The Fatimids typically appointed *amīrs* or *wālīs* over Morocco, often leveraging Zenata tribes like the Miknasa. In response, the Umayyads countered by bestowing titles, gold, and robes of honor (*khil‘a*) upon rival tribes such as the Maghrawa and certain Idrissid princes. This dynamic led to a constant "tug-of-war," exemplified by Córdoba’s Caliph Abd al-Rahman III, who in 931 dispatched armies into Morocco, compelling many Idrissid and Zenata leaders to switch their allegiance from Fatimid to Umayyad. This era was characterized by frequent "double allegiance," where a chieftain might mint coins in the name of Córdoba one year and be recorded as a Fatimid governor the next.

By the mid-11th century, Morocco remained fragmented, with Idrissid remnants in the Rif, the Maghrawa in Fes under nominal Umayyad protection, the Barghawata on the Atlantic coast, and the Banū Ifran in Tlemcen and Salé. The collapse of the Umayyad Caliphate in Córdoba in 1031 and the weakening of Fatimid influence left a power vacuum, with no clear overlord in the region. It was into this chaotic environment that the **Almoravids** (*al-Murābiṭūn*), founded in 1040, emerged. They swept through Morocco from 1058 to 1060, unifying the country militarily and religiously under Maliki Sunni orthodoxy. The Almoravids destroyed the Barghawata state, absorbed the Maghrawa, and ended the Idrissid remnants, establishing a true central power in Morocco for the first time since the early Idrissid period. This effectively ended the "Game of Thrones" scenario where various groups constantly shifted allegiance between Córdoba and Kairouan, with the Almoravids imposing a unified order. Key vassal leaders from this tumultuous period include Musa ibn Abi’l-‘Afiya (Miknasa Zenata), Muhammad ibn Khazar (Maghrawa), al-Hasan ibn al-Qasim (Idrissid), and various Banū Ifran chiefs.

The mid-16th century saw the Portuguese maintain a formidable maritime presence on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, exemplified by the fortified city of Mazagan (modern El Jadida). This bastion was entirely conceived, constructed, and sustained by sea power, serving as a crucial European foothold that relied on open supply lines across the Atlantic. The decision to build a major fortification at Mazagan was a direct response to the rising power of the Saadian Sultanate, particularly after the capture of the Portuguese fortress of Santa Cruz (Agadir) in 1541\. King John III ordered the evacuation of less defensible positions to concentrate resources on Mazagan, which was built between 1541 and 1548 by a team of leading military architects including João Ribeiro, Juan Castillo, and Benedetto da Ravenna. The fortress was a masterclass in Renaissance military engineering: a formidable star-shaped polygon, approximately 250 by 300 meters, featuring four massive bastions (Angel, St Sebastian, St Antoine, and Holy Ghost) with walls averaging 8 meters in height and 10 meters in thickness, designed to absorb cannon fire. A wide, seawater-filled moat completed its landward defenses. This design implicitly acknowledged that Portugal could not control the vast Moroccan interior but could render a land-based siege futile by leveraging its naval strength. The fortress's direct and protected "Seagate" provided continuous reinforcement and supply via the sea, even when surrounded by an enemy army, making it a static anchor for a dynamic and dominant naval force.

The naval forces sustaining Mazagan were drawn from the Portuguese maritime system, primarily consisting of three classes of ships: carracks, caravels, and galleons. The **carrack**, or *Nau*, was the quintessential vessel of the Age of Discovery, an armed cargo carrier capable of long voyages. By the mid-16th century, these were among the largest ships globally, often over 600 tons displacement and measuring around 37 meters in length with towering forecastles and aftcastles that provided a significant defensive height advantage. An exemplary carrack was the *Santa Catarina de Monte Sinai*, built in 1510 in Cochin, India, of teak, and known for its rich decoration, numerous flags, and substantial armament of deck cannons and smaller breech-loading swivel guns like *berços* and *falcaos*. These swivel guns were particularly effective against lightly armored corsair vessels. The **caravel** was a versatile scout, patrol vessel, and light warship, prized for its speed, agility, and ability to sail close to the wind. By the 16th century, the *caravela redonda* (square-rigged caravel) had emerged, a larger and more robust hybrid combining a square-rigged foremast for speed with three lateen-rigged masts aft for maneuverability. These *caravelas de armada* were true warships, forming the backbone of coastal defense fleets and ideal for escorting convoys and supporting besieged fortresses. The **galleon**, emerging in the mid-16th century, represented an evolutionary leap in warship design. It synthesized the seakeeping of the carrack with the agility of the caravel, resulting in a purpose-built gun platform with a longer, lower, and narrower hull, a flat square tuck stern, and the elimination of the towering forecastle in favor of a long, low beakhead. These innovations provided greater stability, speed, and maneuverability, making the galleon a superior platform for artillery, notably with continuous gun decks allowing for powerful broadsides. The *São João Baptista*, nicknamed the *Botafogo* ("Spitfire"), built in 1534, was an exceptionally large Portuguese galleon of 1,000 tons, reportedly armed with 366 guns, representing the pinnacle of naval technology at the time.

While the precise number of Portuguese ships off Morocco in 1552 is unknown, the relief of Mazagan during the Great Siege of 1562 offers insight into Portugal's dynamic naval mobilization system. This system operated on two tiers: a small, permanent patrol force, likely part of the *Armada do Estreito* (Strait Armada), composed primarily of fast *caravelas de armada* for anti-corsair duties, escort, and immediate support; and a much larger expeditionary capability that could be rapidly assembled in a crisis. The 1562 relief effort saw an initial response from Captain Álvaro de Carvalho, followed by a volunteer force from the Algarve, and finally a large, state-sponsored expedition from Lisbon, mobilizing no fewer than 20,000 men and requiring dozens, if not over a hundred, vessels of all sizes. Therefore, in a year of relative peace like 1552, the visible Portuguese presence would have been a small squadron of 5 to 10 patrol caravels and support craft, backed by the latent potential to summon a massive relief armada of powerful galleons, carracks, and requisitioned vessels within weeks.

The maritime opposition faced by the Portuguese at Mazagan was multifaceted, distinctly separating the Saadian Sultanate's formal military from the semi-autonomous Barbary corsair fleets. The **Saadian Sultanate**, despite controlling a long Atlantic coastline and successfully driving the Portuguese from many Moroccan holdings, did not possess a significant, state-organized navy capable of challenging European fleets in open combat during the mid-16th century. Their military strength was overwhelmingly terrestrial, focused on unifying tribes, defeating rivals like the Wattasids, and waging land wars against Portuguese fortresses using a gunpowder-equipped field army and modern artillery. This land-centric focus came at the expense of naval development, making it impossible for them to successfully besiege a sea-supplied fortress like Mazagan. Evidence of this naval weakness includes Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur negotiating with England in 1581 to import naval timber, indicating a desire to *begin* building a fleet, and the Saadians paying tribute to the Ottoman Regency of Algiers to protect Moroccan shipping from corsair attacks. Consequently, the Saadian maritime presence was limited to small, local craft like fishing boats and coastal traders, outsourcing the naval war against the Portuguese to the Barbary corsairs.

The **Barbary corsairs** represented the true naval threat, operating from bases across North Africa, particularly the Ottoman Regency of Algiers, as well as Moroccan ports like Salé. These corsairs, a mix of local Moors, Turkish adventurers, and European renegades, were masters of raiding warfare, with fleets designed for speed, surprise, and the capture of ships and people, rather than formal naval battles. Their primary vessels were oar-powered galleys and their smaller variants. The **galley** was the supreme warship of the Mediterranean, prioritizing speed and maneuverability, propelled by oarsmen (often Christian slaves). A typical large corsair galley was up to 55 meters long with a narrow 5-meter beam, armed with a bow battery of heavy guns firing forward over a *rambade*, supplemented by anti-personnel swivel guns. Its most potent weapon was its large contingent of fighting men for boarding actions. The **galiot** was a smaller, lighter, and faster version of the galley, highly favored by corsairs for its agility, with 16 to 24 rowing benches per side. The **fusta** was an even smaller, extremely fast oared vessel, essentially a miniature galiot, typically with 10 to 15 rowing benches per side, ideal for coastal raiding and surprise attacks due to its speed and shallow draft. An emerging hybrid design, the **xebec**, also originated in Algiers, combining a narrow, galley-like hull with a powerful three-masted lateen sail plan, making it an exceptional performer under wind power and capable of carrying substantial armament and crew. Corsair fleets were typically mixed squadrons, their tactics focused on profit, avoiding well-armed naval warships, and preying on less-defended merchant vessels using speed, deception, and overwhelming manpower for boarding actions. This created a tactical tension in the waters off Mazagan: high-sided, heavily gunned Portuguese carracks or galleons were formidable in open Atlantic waters with wind, while becalmed sailing ships were vulnerable to the swift, oar-powered corsair vessels that could attack from blind spots.

The broader strategic context around Mazagan was profoundly shaped by the two great Mediterranean superpowers: the Spanish and Ottoman Empires. The **Spanish Navy** maintained a significant presence, mirroring Portugal's in purpose and composition, defending its North African *presidios* (e.g., Melilla, Oran, Ceuta) and vital trade routes. Spain possessed one of the world's most powerful navies, a balanced force of galley squadrons for the Mediterranean and an ocean-going fleet of carracks and galleons for the Atlantic. Spanish ship types were largely identical to the Portuguese, with Spanish admirals Pedro Menéndez de Avilés and Álvaro de Bazán credited with the definitive, sleeker galleon design of the 1550s. While colonial rivals, Spain and Portugal were de facto allies against the common corsair threat in North Africa, leading to a convergence in naval technology and strategy, both adopting the heavily-armed, high-sided galleon to counter oared vessels.

The **Ottoman Imperial Fleet**, based primarily in Istanbul, was the most powerful naval force in the Mediterranean at its peak in the 16th century, cemented by victories at Preveza (1538) and Djerba (1560). Its core was the war galley, deployed for major strategic objectives such as the conquest of Rhodes, the siege of Malta, and the invasion of Cyprus. Ottoman expeditions into Morocco, however, were primarily land-based invasions launched from their province of Algiers, aiming to install vassal rulers in Fez, rather than sustained naval operations on the Atlantic coast, which posed immense logistical challenges for a galley fleet. Instead, the Ottoman Empire pursued a highly effective strategy of proxy warfare in the Western Mediterranean, empowering the Regency of Algiers to act as the forward arm of Ottoman sea power. Algiers became a self-funding military enterprise, sustained by piracy and the slave trade, serving the Sultan's strategic goals by waging a relentless war of attrition against Habsburg Spain and its Portuguese allies, tying down vast Iberian naval assets at minimal cost to the imperial treasury.

**Hayreddin Barbarossa** was the single most impactful individual on the 16th-century Western Mediterranean maritime world, serving as the architect of the very threat the Portuguese fortress of Mazagan was built to withstand. Originally Khiḍr Reis, he and his brother Oruç became leading corsairs, capturing Algiers in 1516 and pledging allegiance to Ottoman Sultan Selim I. This act transformed Algiers into the Regency of Algiers, an official, autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire, providing the corsairs with legitimacy, resources, and Turkish Janissaries, making Algiers the most powerful and feared naval base in the Western Mediterranean. Hayreddin, who became Grand Admiral (*Kapudan Pasha*) of the entire Ottoman Navy, led the Imperial Fleet to its greatest victory at the Battle of Preveza in 1538\. While his direct military actions focused on the heart of Habsburg power in the Mediterranean, his connection to Morocco was twofold: he represented a constant potential threat and rival to the Saadian Sultans, and he forged a strategic alliance with Sayyida al-Hurra, the female corsair ruler of Tétouan, effectively dividing the war against the Iberian powers. Barbarossa's indirect but profound influence on Mazagan stemmed from his institutionalization of Barbary piracy as an instrument of state policy backed by the Ottoman Empire, thereby creating the strategic problem of Algiers and shaping the nature of the sea war on the Barbary Coast.

The mid-16th century culminated over a hundred years of intense maritime conflict between Iberian Christian powers and North African Muslim states, characterized by sieges of coastal fortresses, amphibious landings, and vicious encounters between sailing warships and oared corsairs. The **Great Siege of Mazagan in 1562** serves as a definitive case study of this strategic stalemate, illustrating the interplay between a powerful land army and a fortress sustained by dominant sea power. Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib besieged the fortress with an army of over 100,000 men and siege artillery, employing advanced siege techniques. However, the small Portuguese garrison, constantly replenished with reinforcements, food, ammunition, and military engineers arriving through the sea gate, repelled every assault. The Saadian army's inability to interdict sea supplies ultimately doomed their efforts, proving that a Renaissance fortress, properly supplied by sea, could hold out indefinitely against a numerically superior land army lacking a navy.

**The Battle off Albufeira in 1554** provides an excellent example of a typical anti-corsair action. A Portuguese naval force, primarily of sail-powered caravels, intercepted and pursued a corsair squadron of eight oared vessels from Algiers. The Portuguese ships, benefiting from Atlantic winds, closed the distance and, after a two-hour battle, captured the corsair flagship and another vessel, freeing one hundred Christian captives. This demonstrated the crucial role of permanent Portuguese patrol fleets in coastal security and their advantage in open water with favorable wind.

Though fought entirely on land, the **Battle of Alcácer Quibir in 1578** had decisive naval consequences, reshaping the entire maritime and political landscape of the region. King Sebastian I of Portugal led a massive expeditionary force of some 23,000 men, transported to Tangier by a great naval armada, into the Moroccan interior. On August 4, 1578, near Ksar el-Kebir, this army was annihilated by the Saadian army of Sultan Abd al-Malik, numbering over 50,000 men and well-equipped with gunpowder weapons. King Sebastian, his Moroccan ally, and Sultan Abd al-Malik all died in the battle. This catastrophe bankrupted the Portuguese crown, ended serious Portuguese territorial conquest in Morocco, and plunged Portugal into a succession crisis. This crisis was resolved in 1580 when King Philip II of Spain claimed the Portuguese throne, uniting the two Iberian crowns and their vast global maritime empires under a single ruler, creating an Atlantic superpower and fundamentally altering the balance of power against the Barbary corsairs. For the Saadian Sultanate, the victory elevated its prestige and cemented its independence from Ottoman ambitions.

For those seeking to recreate this world, accurate visual references and specifications for these vessels are crucial. The **Portuguese Carrack** *Santa Catarina de Monte Sinai* (c. 1540 painting) featured a high, rounded stern, towering stern/forecastles, a four-masted square and lateen rig with bonnets, and cannons firing over the rails. The **Portuguese Caravel** (*caravela redonda*, seen in a 1572 Lisbon engraving) had longer/narrower proportions, a relatively low forecastle/sterncastle, and a hybrid rig with a square-rigged foremast and three lateen-rigged masts aft. Early to mid-16th century **Galleons**, exemplified by the *São João Baptista* (1534), eliminated the high forecastle for a long, low beakhead, had a flat "square tuck" stern, a lower, integrated sterncastle, and critically, continuous main gun decks with lidded gunports for broadsides. **Barbary Galleys and Galiots** (19th-century engravings, *La Real* replica) were extremely long and narrow with low freeboard, propelled by a single tier of long oars from an outrigger, one or two lateen sails, a *rambade* gun platform at the bow, a central *corsia*, and a stern pavilion. The **Xebec** (16th-century French design) had a unique, graceful shape with pronounced, overhanging bow and stern, typically three lateen-rigged masts (foremast raked sharply forward), and could use oars for auxiliary propulsion.

Essential resources for further research and accurate modeling include the Museu de Marinha (Lisbon) for Portuguese maritime history, the Museu Marítim (Barcelona) for its replica of the 16th-century galley *La Real*, and the National Maritime Museum (Greenwich) for key iconographic evidence like "Portuguese Carracks off a Rocky Coast." The General Archive of the Indies (Seville) holds primary records for the Spanish Empire. Digital archives, while extensive, complement the limited direct archaeological evidence from 16th-century shipwrecks off Morocco, making surviving iconographic and archival evidence all the more critical for historical reconstruction. The maritime landscape off Mazagan circa 1552 was a complex frontier, an asymmetrical conflict between the blue-water, sail-driven firepower of the Portuguese and the oar-driven, raiding tactics of the Barbary corsairs, all shaped by the broader strategic struggles of the Spanish and Ottoman Empires.

The 16th century transformed the fertile coastal plains of Doukkala, Morocco, into a dynamic and contested frontier where the ambitions of the burgeoning Portuguese maritime empire and the ascendant Saadian Sultanate converged. The Portuguese established fortified trading posts, or *praças fortes*, like Safi, Azemmour, and eventually Mazagan, to control lucrative trade in goods such as wheat, horses, and textiles, essential for their gold and slave trading operations further south. This European encroachment occurred during a period of political fragmentation in Morocco, where the ruling Wattasid dynasty in Fez held tenuous authority, allowing the Saadian Sharifs from the Draa River valley to rise, consolidate power, and unify the country through military resistance against the Portuguese. The Doukkala plains, an agricultural heartland inhabited by Amazigh and Arab tribes, became the primary theater for these interactions, with local tribes forming fluid alliances with either the Portuguese (*mouros de pazes*) or the Saadians. The loss of Agadir to the Saadians in 1541 was a critical turning point that prompted the Portuguese to transform the modest 1514 citadel at Mazagan into a state-of-the-art Renaissance fortress between 1541 and 1548, signifying a strategic consolidation in the face of mounting pressure.

The Portuguese fortress of Mazagan (present-day El Jadida) was a transplanted piece of Europe, designed to function as an autonomous cultural and physical enclave. Its military design, an outstanding example of new European concepts in a colonial context, was entrusted to an international team of leading military engineers: the Italian Benedetto da Ravenna, the Spaniard Juan Castillo, and the Portuguese Joao Ribeiro. Conceived as a **star-shaped plan** (*trace italienne*), approximately 250 by 300 meters, it featured four angled bastions—the Angel, St. Sebastian, St. Antoine, and Holy Ghost Bastions—engineered to eliminate defensive blind spots and create overlapping fields of fire for cannons. Its massive, battered walls, around 8 meters high and 10 meters thick, were designed to deflect cannonballs and enclosed a 2-meter-wide peripheral walkway. The fortress was physically isolated from the mainland by a wide, seawater-filled ditch, about 20 meters across and 3 meters deep, with access controlled by three gates, including a main land entrance and a protected Seagate. Within its formidable military shell, the principal buildings, such as the **Church of the Assumption** and the **Portuguese Cistern**, expressed a unique Portuguese cultural identity through the **Manueline style**, a florid, late Gothic architectural variant. The church showcased intricate ornamentation with maritime motifs, while the vast subterranean cistern, originally an armory or barracks, became renowned for its vaulted ceiling supported by stone columns, a masterpiece of late Gothic engineering later used by Orson Welles in his film *Othello*. These culturally specific buildings underscored Mazagan's dual purpose as a complete, self-contained Portuguese city designed for permanence.

Beyond Mazagan's ramparts, the cities and towns of Doukkala, such as Azemmour, were firmly within the cultural and political orbit of the Saadian Sultanate. The 16th century marked a "renaissance" of Moroccan-Andalusian art and architecture under the Saadians, characterized by intricate interior decoration, privacy, and a rich palette of materials. The Saadian architectural language blended Amazigh, Muslim al-Andalus, and Islamic Middle Eastern influences. **Luxurious materials** included imported Italian Carrara marble, intricately carved and painted **cedarwood** for ceilings (*berchla*) and doors, finely sculpted plaster (*geps* or stucco), and vibrant **mosaic tilework** (*zellij*). Decoration adhered to Islamic aniconism, featuring complex geometric motifs, often radiating star patterns in *zellij*, elaborate vegetal *arabesques* and three-dimensional honeycomb *muqarnas* in stucco, and Arabic calligraphy in wood. **Horseshoe arches** were ubiquitous, and square-shafted minarets remained standard in religious architecture. The principles of this aesthetic were domestically expressed in the urban elite residences, the *dar* or *riad*, designed with an inward focus to protect privacy (*hurma*). These homes featured austere, often windowless, exteriors, with a **bent or L-shaped entrance** (*skifa*) blocking direct views into the **central courtyard** (*wast ad-dar*), which served as the primary source of light and ventilation. Rooms were arranged symmetrically around this courtyard, often with a central fountain or a symmetrical four-part garden in a *riad*. Surviving Saadian residences in Marrakech, like Dar Cherifa, demonstrate this style, featuring characteristic courtyard layouts and lavish carved stucco and wood decorations similar to the Ben Youssef Madrasa. A comparative analysis highlights the Portuguese architecture's outward-facing military projection and separation, using cut stone and Renaissance influences, versus the Saadian's inward-facing domestic tranquility and integration, using rammed earth, mudbrick, stucco, wood, and tile, with pervasive *zellij* and carved decoration.

Beyond the cities, the rural Doukkala plains nurtured its own unique vernacular architectural tradition, driven by function, local materials, and communal knowledge. The most distinctive example is the **Tazota**, a form of dry-stone construction found exclusively in this region, concentrated around 20 km from El Jadida. *Tazotas* are built without mortar, mud, or any binding agent, using stones cleared from the land for farming. They typically take a spherical or frustum-of-a-cone shape, resembling solid stone mounds, with thick walls and a semi-spherical dome providing excellent thermal insulation. Originally used as primary dwellings and shelters for landowners, often with an underground gallery (*Toufri*) for grain storage, *Tazotas* later served as storage or animal shelters. While their precise origins are uncertain, local inhabitants suggest a 19th-century origin for nomadic populations transitioning to agriculture, though the timeless nature of such techniques implies they were likely an established part of the Doukkala landscape during the 16th century. The *Tazota*'s construction from the very landscape it occupies embodies a perfect cycle of sustainability, transforming farming obstacles into essential infrastructure.

The commercial activity in 16th-century Doukkala's coastal hubs like Azemmour and Safi necessitated a well-developed market infrastructure. The **traditional souk** was not a single building but a labyrinthine network of narrow, winding, and often covered alleyways deep within the city's medina. Its layout was highly organized, with main arteries connecting city gates to the central mosque, and trades clustered into specialized quarters (e.g., *Souk Haddadine* for blacksmiths, *Souk el Attarine* for spice merchants). A strict economic hierarchy placed valuable and "cleanest" goods near the mosque, while "noisier" trades were further out. Shops and workshops were typically small units on the ground floors of residential buildings, opening directly onto the alleyway. Streets were often covered for shade, and construction materials were local and functional, such as rammed earth, mudbrick, stone, and wood. Essential to this trading ecosystem was the **funduq**, or urban caravanserai, a multi-story building with a courtyard, providing stables and secure storage on the ground floor and lodging for traveling merchants on upper floors, serving as hotels, warehouses, and wholesale markets.

To visually contextualize this architectural landscape, the 1606 map ***Fessae et Marocchi Regna*** by the Dutch cartographer **Jodocus Hondius** offers an invaluable, albeit biased, European perspective. Published in the Mercator-Hondius Atlas, this hand-colored copper engraving covered the North African coast and was embellished with illustrations of sailing ships and a sea monster. The map reveals a distinct focus on the coastal areas—primary zones of European trade, navigation, and military engagement—while the interior regions, the heartland of the Saadian Sultanate, are depicted with significantly less detail, often filled with generic mountains and forests. This cartographic bias highlights the limits of European knowledge and influence inland. Key settlements in the Doukkala region labeled on the map include "Duccala" for the entire region, "Mazagam" for the Portuguese fortress, "Azamor" (Azemmour) at the mouth of the Oum Er-Rbia river, and "Saffi" (Safi) further south. Smaller coastal settlements like "Tit" are also marked, but inland towns are largely unnamed and generically represented, confirming the European coastal focus.

In conclusion, the 16th-century built environment of the Doukkala plains presented a profound triad of architectural contrasts. The **Portuguese Renaissance Fortress** of Mazagan represented an architecture of imposition, technologically advanced, culturally sealed, and projecting power outward through its star-shaped bastions and massive walls, symbolizing a colonial ideology of isolation. The **Saadian Hispano-Moorish Style**, found in urban centers like Azemmour, was an architecture of opulence and introspection, rooted in Andalusian and Islamic artistic traditions, prioritizing lavishly decorated, private interior worlds through *zellij*, carved stucco, and cedarwood. Finally, the **Doukkala Vernacular Tradition**, exemplified by the unique *Tazota*, was an architecture of symbiosis—functional, unadorned, and built from local stones, representing an intimate and sustainable relationship with the agricultural landscape. These coexisting architectural paradigms vividly reflect the era's complex dynamics, serving as a powerful and enduring lens into Moroccan history at a pivotal crossroads.

The art of the book in Marinid and Wattasid Morocco (c. 1250-1550) involved sophisticated techniques and materials, reflecting a significant period of intellectual flourishing and artistic refinement. This era saw the gradual transition from parchment to paper as the dominant writing surface, the flourishing of distinct Maghrebi calligraphic styles, and the development of intricate binding decorations.

The choice of writing material was fundamental, with **parchment** dominating at the beginning of the Marinid period. This durable material, made from animal skin through a laborious process of soaking, scraping, and stretching on a wooden frame, was susceptible to environmental changes, necessitating heavy wooden covers and robust clasps to keep books flat. While **paper** was available earlier—Fez was a major paper manufacturing center with over 100 mills by the 11th century and 400 by the 12th century—parchment held a cultural and religious prestige, particularly for high-status and sacred texts like the Qur'an. The shift to paper for these texts became widespread only in the later Marinid period, driven by increased demand for books from a flourishing intellectual life in Fez. Regardless of material, surfaces were meticulously prepared with faint ruled lines for orderly writing, and paper sheets were often sized with wheat starch and burnished to prevent ink bleed.

The visual character of manuscripts was also defined by **inks and illumination**. Main texts were typically written in dark brown or black **iron-gall ink**, preferred for its permanence and crisp lines, made from vitriol and oak galls. **Colored inks**, derived from natural sources like cinnabar (red), azurite or indigo (blue), orpiment or verdigris (green), and realgar (yellow/orange), were used for headings, marks, and commentary, contributing to the page's aesthetic. **Illumination (*tadhhib*)**, the application of gold or silver leaf, was reserved for luxury manuscripts, especially Qur'ans. Gold leaf was affixed with adhesive and burnished to create a brilliant, mirror-like surface. Late North African manuscripts, particularly from the 15th century onward, were characterized by an exceptionally wide and vibrant range of colors—orange, red, yellow, green, pink, and blue—used alongside gold for intricate arabesques and stylized floral motifs in frontispieces, *surah* headings, and verse markers.

**Maghrebi calligraphy** was the soul of the manuscript, flourishing into a distinct tradition during the Marinid era. It evolved from ancient Kufic script in North Africa and al-Andalus, with Andalusi refugees in Fez further enriching its development. Manuscripts typically featured a clear hierarchy: **Maghrebi cursive** (broad, flowing, with deep, rounded curves) for the main text, usually in brown or black ink; and a more angular, decorative **Maghrebi Kufic** for high-impact elements like Qur'anic chapter headings, often executed in gold leaf. Calligraphy was a noble pursuit, even practiced by rulers like Sultan Abu al-Hasan, who personally copied four Qur'ans.

The **binding** served as the manuscript's protective shell and public face. Text blocks, formed from gatherings of parchment or paper, were sewn onto horizontal supports, typically double cords of hemp or leather thongs. The covers, made of wooden boards (for parchment) or pasteboard (for paper), were strongly attached by lacing the sewing supports directly through them. A defining feature of Islamic bindings from this region was the **fore-edge flap**, a pentagonal flap attached to the back cover that folded over the pages to protect them from dust and damage.

For luxury bindings, **Morocco leather** (high-quality goatskin) was the material of choice, prized for its strength, pliability, visible grain, dye affinity (deep reds, greens, blues, dark browns), and ability to take tooling. Wooden boards were common for high-status parchment manuscripts, while lighter pasteboard, made by laminating paper, was used for paper texts, particularly later in the period. **Protective features** such as metal clasps or leather straps were almost always fitted to parchment books to counteract the material's tendency to swell and warp with humidity, keeping pages flat. Decorative metal "furniture" like ornate corner pieces or central bosses could also be added for deluxe bindings. The shift to dimensionally stable paper reduced the need for these heavy fittings, with later paper manuscripts typically relying on lighter pasteboards and only the fore-edge flap for closure.

The **decoration of Moroccan book covers** followed a sophisticated "grammar of ornament" rooted in geometry and symmetry, shared across various Marinid artistic media. Designs were almost invariably centered on a prominent **medallion**, often a lozenge, an eight-pointed star, a mandorla (almond shape), or a circular motif. These central medallions were typically complemented by four corner-pieces and enclosed within decorative borders, with the design repeated on both covers. The dominant style was **complex geometric interlace**, often originating from an eight-pointed star, with interlacing bands forming a repeating network of stars, polygons, and crosses. This geometric vocabulary was a core component of Marinid artistic identity, seen in cedarwood carvings, stucco, and *zellij* tilework. **Arabesques** (fluid, organic patterns of scrolling foliage) filled the polygonal spaces within geometric interlace, providing a dynamic contrast. Stylized floral motifs were also incorporated, but these were abstract and integrated into scrollwork, differing from the more naturalistic floral designs of Ottoman art that gained influence only from the 17th century.

These intricate designs were brought to life using **tooling and gilding**. **Blind tooling** involved impressing patterns into dampened leather with heated metal tools, creating darker, burnished, permanent impressions. For luxury bindings, **gold tooling (gilding)** was employed, where a blind-tooled impression was coated with an adhesive (like egg white), covered with gold leaf, and then re-impressed with a heated tool to permanently adhere the gold. This technique of gold tooling is historically believed to have developed in North Africa before spreading to Mamluk Egypt, Persia, and eventually Europe. In some deluxe examples, particularly those influenced by the Mamluk tradition, gilded designs were subtly embellished with small areas of painted light blue pigment.

The intellectual content of books during this period was vast, reflecting a golden age of scholarship. A curated list of 30 significant texts available around 1550 includes foundational religious works like the **Qur'an** and **Hadith collections** (e.g., *Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī*, *al-Muwaṭṭaʾ*). **Biographies of the Prophet** (e.g., Qadi 'Iyad's *al-Shifāʾ*) and **devotional texts** (e.g., al-Jazuli's *Dalāʾil al-Khayrāt*, al-Busiri's *Qaṣīdat al-Burdah*) were highly popular. **Historical and sociological works** included Ibn Khaldun's monumental *al-Muqaddimah* and chronicles of Moroccan history like Ibn Abi Zar's *Rawḍ al-Qirṭās*. **Travelogues** by figures like Ibn Battuta (*Tuḥfat an-Nuẓẓār*) and **geographical works** by al-Idrisi (*Nuzhat al-Mushtāq*) were also key. **Legal texts** of the Maliki school, such as al-Wansharisi's *al-Miʿyār al-Muʿrib* and Khalil ibn Ishaq's *al-Mukhtaṣar*, were foundational. **Scientific and philosophical works** covered mathematics (Ibn al-Banna's *Talkhīṣ aʿmāl al-ḥisāb*, al-Khwarizmi's *al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar*, Euclid's *Elements*), astronomy (al-Murrakushi's *Jāmiʿ al-mabādiʾ...*, Ptolemy's *Almagest*), medicine (Ibn Sina's *al-Qānūn fī al-Ṭibb*, Ibn al-Baytar's *Kitāb al-jāmiʿ...*), and philosophy (Ibn Rushd's commentaries on Aristotle, Ibn Tufayl's *Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān*). Theological, Sufi, and literary works by figures like al-Ghazali and al-Hariri, and grammar primers like Ibn 'Ajarrum's *al-Ājurrūmiyya*, further filled these libraries.

For modern artisans seeking to recreate these historical books, specific profiles guide historically faithful reproductions. A **Royal Marinid Qur'an (c. 1300-1350)** would feature high-quality parchment, large formal Maghrebi cursive with gold Kufic headings, lavish illumination including a double-page frontispiece, thick wooden boards covered in fine dyed Morocco goatskin, elaborate full-cover gold tooling with eight-pointed star geometric interlace, and heavy brass or bronze clasps. A **Scholar's Legal Text (c. 1450-1500)** would use good quality paper, functional Maghrebi script with red ink highlights, stiff pasteboard covers in sturdy Morocco or calfskin, entirely blind tooling with a central lozenge or mandorla medallion, and rely solely on the fore-edge flap for closure without clasps. A **Sufi's Devotional Book (c. 1470-1550)**, in a smaller portable paper format, would have clear Maghrebi cursive, modest gold illumination, pasteboard covers in good quality Morocco leather (perhaps green), and a tasteful mix of blind and gold tooling, possibly with arabesque elements, and no clasps.

In the mid-16th century, Morocco's geopolitical landscape was significantly shaped by the ascendancy of the Saadian dynasty. Having overthrown the Wattasids by 1554, the Saadians unified the country, successfully resisted the Ottoman Empire's expansion, and established Morocco as the sole North African power outside Ottoman control. This burgeoning influence was projected through a modernized military and command over lucrative trans-Saharan trade routes. The Saadian Sultanate's military might, economic prosperity, and symbolic authority were deeply intertwined with the animal kingdom that inhabited its domain. Three key animals played critical roles: the Barb horse and the Dromedary camel served as the living engines of the Saadian state, while the Atlas lion, though receding into the wild, functioned as a potent, living emblem of royal power and a deep connection to regional heritage. The formidable but elusive Atlas bear was also part of this rich ecological backdrop.

The Barb horse was an indispensable asset to the Saadian military. An ancient breed, likely tracing its lineage back 4,000 years, it was the quintessential mount of Berber tribes for millennia, with its name derived from the Barbary Coast itself. It is a relatively small but powerfully built horse, typically 13.3 to 15.2 hands high, characterized by a strong front end, a short robust back, high withers, and a low-set tail. Its facial profile is straight or slightly convex, distinguishing it from the Arabian horse. A notable genetic trait, potentially shared with the Arabian, is the presence of five lumbar vertebrae instead of the usual six, contributing to its exceptional stamina and weight-carrying ability. Beyond its physical form, the Barb possessed a "golden character," combining "hot-blooded" sensitivity with remarkable controllability, intelligence, patience, and docility. It was exceptionally trainable, hardy, sure-footed, and endured long distances with minimal food or water, capable of sprinting over short distances.

The Barb's temperament was crucial for the Saadian army's military revolution, which integrated gunpowder weapons like arquebuses and cannons into traditional tribal equestrian warfare. Unlike the Songhai Empire's cattle, which stampeded in terror at the Battle of Tondibi in 1591 due to the noise of Saadian firearms, the Barb's calm nature allowed the Saadians to successfully fuse cavalry mobility with modern firepower, giving them a decisive tactical advantage. Leo Africanus, a contemporary diplomat and geographer, noted that "good horses" for warfare and royal use were specifically sourced from Barbary. The Barb horse was more than a military tool; it was a symbol of Moroccan national heritage, vividly expressed in the *Tbourida* (Fantasia), an equestrian spectacle dating to the 16th century. Its influence extended globally, playing a foundational role in developing Iberian breeds like the Andalusian and Lusitano, and significantly contributing to the English Thoroughbred. King Henry VIII of England even imported Barbary horses in the 16th century to improve his royal stables.

If the Barb horse was the tactical soul, the Dromedary camel (*Camelus dromedarius*) was the strategic backbone of the Saadian state. This one-humped camel was uniquely capable of facilitating large-scale, long-distance movement across the Sahara Desert, transforming it into a conduit for commerce and conquest. The Dromedary is a masterpiece of biological engineering, adapted to arid habitats with features like two rows of long eyelashes, bushy eyebrows, closable nostrils, thick rubbery lips for thorny plants, and wide, soft feet for navigating sand. Internally, its hump stores up to 36 kg of fat, serving as a vital energy and water reserve. A thirsty camel can drink over 100 liters of water in ten minutes, aided by unique oval-shaped red blood cells that absorb this intake without rupturing. These adaptations made the Dromedary the engine of trans-Saharan caravan routes for centuries, linking Moroccan trade hubs like Sijilmasa to West African empires, transporting goods like salt, textiles, and manufactured items south in exchange for gold, ivory, and slaves.

The strategic importance of the camel to the Saadian state is best illustrated by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur's 1591 invasion of the Songhai Empire. Driven by the desire to control the trans-Saharan gold and slave trade to finance his state-building projects, al-Mansur faced the immense logistical challenge of moving an army across the Sahara. This feat was accomplished with an enormous logistical train of an estimated 8,000 Dromedary camels, which transported thousands of soldiers, their food, water, and modern weaponry, including heavy arquebuses and cannons, over a grueling 135-day march. The camel thus functioned as a mobile logistics platform for heavy artillery, allowing the Saadians to project a technologically superior force across the continent and achieve complete strategic surprise against the Songhai ruler, who was unprepared for a desert attack. This campaign demonstrated how the camel transformed the Sahara into a viable theater of military operations, weaponizing logistics to extend the reach of the Moroccan state and fulfill its imperial ambitions.

While horses and camels were instruments of power, the Atlas lion (*Panthera leo leo*) was the living symbol of Saadian authority. This formidable predator, native to Morocco's mountains and forests, was physically distinct from its sub-Saharan relatives, being one of the largest lion subspecies with reports of males weighing up to 230 kg, and some 19th-century hunter claims reaching 270-300 kg. Its most striking feature was a magnificent dark, shaggy mane extending over its head, shoulders, chest, and sometimes belly. Adapted to the temperate, often colder, climate of the Atlas and Rif mountain ranges and Mediterranean forests, it likely lived a more solitary life or in small family units, unlike the large prides found in sub-Saharan Africa. Its diet primarily consisted of native large herbivores like the Barbary stag, gazelles, and wild boar, though as human settlement expanded, it increasingly preyed on domestic livestock, escalating human-lion conflict.

The history of the Barbary lion is one of tragic decline. Fossils dating back over 100,000 years near Essaouira indicate its ancient presence. The first major blow to its population occurred during the Roman Empire, when thousands were captured for gladiatorial games (*venationes*) in arenas like the Colosseum. By the mid-16th century Saadian era, the lion was scarcer but still a known and feared inhabitant of Morocco's wilder regions. Leo Africanus described annual pilgrimages to a holy man's tomb seeking protection from these great predators, indicating their continued danger to rural communities. The final chapter of its existence was swift and brutal, driven by the proliferation of modern firearms and systematic eradication campaigns encouraged by Turkish and later French colonial administrations. The last confirmed wild Barbary lion was shot in 1942 in the Moroccan Atlas Mountains near the Tizi n'Tichka pass, effectively vanishing from its natural realm, with its decline accelerating in lockstep with modern technology and colonial power.

For centuries, Moroccan sultans maintained royal menageries, with the Barbary lion as the prized collection piece. This tradition carried powerful dual symbolism: Berber tribes presented lion cubs as tribute, signifying their submission to the throne and the symbolic caging of the mountains' wildness. Conversely, during the 16th century under the Saadians, these captive lions were reportedly used as instruments of state terror, with prisoners and condemned criminals thrown to them in public displays of the sultan's absolute power over life and death. The royal lions were thus a complex political tool, embodying both fealty and justice. This royal collection forms the basis for the modern belief that the pure Barbary lion lineage may have survived in captivity, with descendants now found in zoos, notably the Rabat Zoo.

The physical extinction of the Atlas lion in the wild did not erase its presence from the Moroccan imagination; instead, it transformed into an enduring cultural emblem. Its journey from a symbol of 16th-century royal power to 21st-century national pride reflects Morocco's changing identity. The lion's status as a symbol of strength, courage, and royalty is ancient, with deep roots in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cultures, appearing in Islamic art associated with kingship and revered religious figures like Ali ibn abi Talib ("Asadullah"). For the indigenous Amazigh peoples, it was an immediate and potent symbol of their homeland's untamed spirit. Saadian art and architecture elegantly navigated the tension between Islamic aniconism and the royal prerogative to use figural imagery to project power. While religious monuments like the Saadian Tombs were masterpieces of non-figural art, adorned with *zellij*, stucco arabesques, and calligraphy, the secular royal palace relaxed this rule. Notably, the monumental fountain in Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur's Dar al-Hana palace featured sculpted figures of a lion and leopards, a calculated political statement modeling his court on Al-Andalus, specifically the Nasrid Alhambra's Court of the Lions. This declaration visually positioned Marrakesh as the new Granada and the Saadian court as the inheritor of Moorish Spain's high culture. In the modern era, the lion was resurrected as a powerful symbol of Moroccan identity, with the national football team famously nicknamed "Lions of the Atlas" (*أسود الأطلس*), linking the nation with the lion's strength, pride, courage, and majesty. This modern symbolism is deeply connected to the lion's extinction, largely carried out during the colonial period. Its post-colonial adoption as a national emblem represents an act of reclamation, symbolizing Moroccan resilience, independence, and pride, transforming a story of ecological tragedy into a narrative of enduring national spirit.

To illustrate the complex relationship between the Saadian dynasty and the Atlas lion, a conceptual scene for a narrative-driven video game is presented, titled "The Gilded Cage". The character is Zaydan, the fictional second son of Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur, who holds the prestigious but politically sidelined role of Keeper of the Royal Menagerie. Zaydan is depicted as a scholar and naturalist, caught between his genuine admiration for the animals and his duty to a court that views them as mere political tools. His internal conflict between the wild natural world and the rigid palace mirrors the dynasty's tension between its rugged Berber origins and its cosmopolitan imperial ambitions. The scene is set around 1585 in a secluded courtyard of the newly constructed El Badi Palace in Marrakesh, featuring intricate *zellij* tilework, the scent of orange blossoms, distant Atlas Mountains, a gentle fountain, and the musky odor of the menagerie. Zaydan encounters a massive, dark-maned Atlas lion in an ornate, strong cage of iron and cedarwood. The lion lies still, its gaze fixed on the distant mountains, its lost home. Zaydan approaches with awe and sorrow, seeing not a symbol of his father's power, but a king in exile. He marvels at the lion's size and mane, recalling stories of solitary mountain hunters, feeling guilt that his father views this magnificent creature as a future spectacle, a tool of terror for condemned prisoners. Zaydan feels a profound kinship with the lion; both are powerful beings yet captives of the Sultan's ambition, the lion having lost its freedom, and Zaydan his purpose. In a symbolic climax, Zaydan rests his hand on the cold iron of the cage, whispering an old Amazigh poem about mountain freedom. The lion turns its head, and in its golden gaze, Zaydan sees a reflection of his own soul—a captive royalty, a tragic grandeur. When the lion finally opens its mouth, the sound is not a roar of anger, but a deep, resonant call of profound and inconsolable loss.

In conclusion, animals were active participants and essential components in the construction of the mid-16th century Saadian state. The Barb horse provided the tactical agility to integrate new gunpowder technologies and dominate the battlefield, while the Dromedary camel furnished the strategic and logistical capacity for imperial expansion across the Sahara. Both animals' legacies are etched into historical records and remain vital elements of Moroccan cultural heritage. The Atlas lion, though physically extinct, has undergone a powerful transformation from a living creature and instrument of royal terror to an enduring national emblem. Its loss, accelerated by later technologies and politics, created a void from which a new symbolism of Moroccan identity, strength, and resilience has emerged, with its roar continuing to resonate in the heart of Morocco.

Moroccan history spans hundreds of thousands of years, with archaeological evidence indicating hominids were present at least 400,000 years ago in Salé, and early *Homo sapiens* bones dating back 300,000 years excavated at Jebel Irhoud in 1991\. The Capsian period (7500–4000 BCE) is noted for Neolithic rock art motifs that are linked to geometric patterns found in Amazigh tattoos, suggesting a continuity of symbolic communication.

Recorded history began with **Phoenician colonization** of the Moroccan coast between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. Phoenician traders established depots and settlements, including Chellah, Lixus, and Mogador, marking the beginning of foreign rule in northern Morocco. By the 5th century BCE, Carthage extended its hegemony over these coastal areas, a presence that concluded by the late 3rd century BCE, with indigenous Berber monarchs continuing to rule the hinterland. From the 3rd century BCE to 40 CE, Berber monarchs governed the territory. Juba II was granted authority over Mauritania by Augustus in 25 BCE, overseeing the Romanization of northwest Africa and the development of Volubilis into a major city. Following Juba II's death in 23 CE, his son Ptolemy struggled with tribal unrest, leading to a Roman suppression of a rebellion led by Tacfarinas. In 40 CE, Emperor Caligula assassinated Ptolemy, and Mauritania was formally annexed, becoming the Roman province of Mauritania Tingitana. The region was later overrun by Vandals in the mid-5th century CE and reconquered by the Byzantine Empire in the 6th century CE.

The **Muslim conquest of Morocco** occurred in the early 8th century CE. However, in 740 CE, the **Berber Revolt** led to Morocco breaking away from the Umayyad Caliphate, initiating a period of independent Berber states. Among these was the **Barghawata**, a confederation of Masmuda Berber groups, which established an independent state in Tamesna near the Atlantic coast from 744 to 1058 CE. They resisted for three centuries before being eliminated by the Almohads. In 757 CE, the Midrarid dynasty founded the Emirate of Sijilmasa in the Tafilalt region.

The **Idrisid Dynasty** was established in 788 CE when Idris ibn Abdallah, a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad who fled the Arabian Peninsula in 786 CE, was welcomed by the Awraba Berber tribe in Volubilis. This marked the foundation of the first autonomous Islamic state in Morocco. Fez, founded by Idris II, son and successor of Idris I, became the Idrisid capital and a sacred religious center in the 9th century. The Qarawiyyin mosque, often depicted as the "oldest college in the world," was established in Fez during this period. Following Idris II's death in 828 CE, the kingdom was divided among seven of his sons, leading to the formation of eight Idrisid statelets. Muhammad, son of Idris II, ruled from 828 to 836 CE, during which the division occurred. His brothers Isa and Umar also held sway, with Isa revolting and controlling coastal Tamesna from Chellah, and Umar (d. 835 CE) punishing Isa and governing Tangier. Ali ibn Umar inherited his father Umar's domains. Ali ibn Muhammad (r. 836–849 CE) inherited Muhammad's position and ruled competently, followed by Yahya ibn Muhammad (Yahya I, r. 849–863 CE), who enjoyed a peaceful reign. However, the Fatimids, with their Miknasa Berber allies, drove the Idrisids from Fez in 921 CE, forcing them to retreat to the Rif Mountains. Idrisid rule formally ended in 985 CE when the last ruler was captured and executed by the Umayyads.

The **Almoravid Empire** (1040–1147 CE) began with the efforts of Yahya ibn Ibrahim, a Gudala chieftain, who went on pilgrimage to Mecca around 1040 and sought a Maliki teacher, leading him to Abdallah ibn Yasin in the Sous valley. Ibn Yasin, the spiritual leader, founded the Almoravid movement, with Yusuf ibn Tashfin (d. 1106 CE) as its military leader. Abdallah ibn Yasin established a *ribat* to instill strict Maliki Islamic doctrine. Almoravid forces, led by Yahya bin Umar (d. 1056 CE) and guided by Ibn Yasin, captured Sijilmasa from the Maghrawa in 1053 CE. The Almoravids reunified Morocco and extended their power into Al-Andalus. In 1085 CE, Christian King Alfonso VI of Castile (r. 1065-1109 CE) captured Toledo, prompting the Taifa kingdoms of al-Andalus to appeal to Yusuf ibn Tashfin for aid. In 1086 CE, Yusuf ibn Tashfin led Almoravid forces to a decisive victory over Castilian forces at the Battle of Sagrajas (al-Zallaqah), halting the Christian Reconquista for a generation. By 1090 CE, he deposed the Taifa kings and annexed al-Andalus to his empire, uniting the Maghreb and Islamic Spain.

The **Almohad Empire** (1121–1269 CE) began when Ibn Tumart (d. 1130 CE), a Masmuda Berber scholar, declared himself the Mahdi in 1121 CE. He preached divine unity and launched a holy war against the Almoravids. Abd al-Mu'min (r. 1133–1163 CE), the first Almohad Caliph, conquered Marrakesh in 1147 CE, ending Almoravid rule and leading to the destruction of Almoravid mosques in the city due to claims of incorrect orientation. He expanded the Almohad empire, creating the largest empire ever ruled from Morocco. His son, Abu Yaqub Yusuf I (r. 1163–1184 CE), succeeded him. Another son, Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur (r. 1184–1199 CE), became Caliph and was the victor of the Battle of Alarcos. In 1153 CE, the philosopher and astronomer Ibn Rushd (d. 1198 CE) began his astronomical observations in Marrakech, associated with the Almohad court. The second Kutubiyya Mosque, larger and with a huge minaret, was completed in Marrakesh around 1158 CE. In 1184 CE, Abu Yaqub Yusuf I built the Giralda, the minaret of the mosque in Seville. Muhammad al-Nasir (r. 1199–1213 CE), son of al-Mansur, suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 CE against a coalition of Christian kingdoms in Spain, marking the beginning of the end for Muslim Spain and Almohad power in al-Andalus. His young son, Yusuf II "al-Mustansir" (r. 1213–1224 CE), was appointed caliph at age ten. The Almohad empire began to fragment, with Ifriqiya breaking away under Abu Zakariyya al-Hafs in 1230 CE. The Zayyanid state was founded in Tlemcen by Yaghmurasan ibn Abd al-Wadid in 1235 CE. The last Almohad caliph was killed in Marrakesh by the Marinids in 1269 CE, ending the dynasty.

During this broader period, renowned scholars contributed significantly. Abd al-Wahid Al-Murrakushi (born 1185 CE), a historian, studied in Marrakech, Fes, and Spain before moving to Egypt. He completed a history of the Almohad dynasty, *Kitab al-mu’jib fi talkhis akhbar ahl al-Maghrib*, in 1224 CE. His main scientific work was *Jami’ al-Mabadi’ wa-‘l-ghayat fi ‘ilm al-miqat*, a compilation on astronomical instruments, trigonometry, and gnomonics. Ibn al-Banna (d. 1321 CE), a great Moroccan mathematician and astronomer from Marrakech, authored *Talkhīṣ aʿmāl al-ḥisab* and *Tanbih al-albab*, the latter addressing mathematical problems in everyday life. Al-Idrisi (d. 1166 CE), a renowned geographer born in Ceuta, studied in Cordoba and created a scientifically accurate silver planisphere, authoring *Nuzhat al-Mushtāq...* ("Roger's Book"). Ibn Battuta (d. 1369 CE), a famous Moroccan traveler, documented his extensive journeys across Africa and Asia in his *Rihla* (travelogue). Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406 CE), though born in Tunis, was a major intellectual figure of the Marinid era who wrote *al-Muqaddimah*, laying the foundations of sociology and philosophy of history.

The **Marinid Dynasty** (c. 1244-1465 CE) took control of Fez in 1245 CE and eventually killed the last Almohad caliph in Marrakesh in 1269 CE, ending the Almohad dynasty. The Marinids ruled Morocco, establishing the *madrasa* system and fostering a golden age of culture in Fez. The first Marinid *madrasa* was built by Abu Yusuf Ya'qub between 1270 and 1280 CE. Fez Jdid was founded by the Marinids in 1276 CE as their administrative and military center. They occupied Spanish towns like Rota, Tarifa, and Gibraltar in 1294 CE to control trade in the Strait of Gibraltar. The Al-Attarine Madrasa, a masterpiece of Hispano-Moorish style, was built in Fez between 1323 and 1325 CE. The Bou Inania Madrasa, another masterpiece, was built in Fez between 1351 and 1356 CE. Water-clocks were significant; Ibn al-Habbak al-Tilimsani built one in the minaret of the Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fez in 1286/87 CE, which was restored in 1346-48 CE by Abu Abdallah al-'Arabi. Another weight-powered water clock was constructed next to the Abu 'Inaniyya Madrasa by Abu 'l-Hasan Ibn Ali Ahmad al-Tilimsani in 1357 CE. The Marinid decline began with Abu al-Hasan being deposed by his son Abu Inan Faris in 1348 CE, followed by Abu Inan Faris being strangled by his vizier in 1358 CE. Portugal began its expansion into North Africa by capturing Ceuta in 1415 CE. In 1437 CE, a Portuguese attempt to take Tangier failed, successfully defended by Abu Zakariyya Yahya al-Wattasi, though the Portuguese did occupy Ksar es-Seghir.

The period of **Marinid and Wattasid bookmaking** (c. 1150-1550 CE) saw significant activity in book production, including the use of parchment and paper (with Fez as a major center), Maghrebi calligraphy, and Morocco leather bindings with geometric interlace patterns.

The **Wattasid family** seized control of Fez from the Marinids in 1458 CE after a massacre. The **Wattasid Dynasty** formally ruled in Fez from 1472 to 1554 CE, but their power declined amidst internal strife and foreign incursions. Sayyida al-Hurra (c. 1440 \- after 1542 CE) was born in northern Morocco and successfully ruled Tétouan for over three decades (c. 1510-1542 CE). Her father, Moulay Ali ben Rashid (born pre-1471 CE), founded Chefchaouen in 1471 CE to defend against the Portuguese. He was of sharif descent and had learned military skills in Granada. Sayyida al-Hurra's mother was Lala Zahra, born in Cadiz, who converted to Islam after marrying Moulay Ali ben Rashid. Sayyida al-Hurra married Moulay Ali Al-Mandri (Governor 1504-1519 CE), the governor of Tétouan, in 1510 CE, a marriage aimed at strengthening ties and creating an ally against the Portuguese. Her oldest brother was Moulay Ibrahim.

The **fall of Granada** in 1492 CE led to large waves of Muslim and Jewish emigrants and refugees to Morocco. Spanish forces captured Melilla in 1497 CE, and the Portuguese took Massa in the south that same year. Portugal also established an early foothold on the Atlantic coast by capturing Mazagan in 1502 CE. Wattasid Mohammed al-Burtuqali (r. 1504 CE) succeeded Abu Abd Allah al-Sheikh Muhammad ibn Yahya as sultan. The Portuguese further expanded their presence, occupying Tangier, Asilah, and Ksar es-Seghir in 1471 CE. Ali Abu Hassun (d. 1554 CE) was the last Wattasid sultan, who briefly retook Fez in 1554 with Ottoman help before being defeated and killed by Saadian forces.

The **Saadian Dynasty** (1549-1659 CE) began its rise in 1510 CE when Muhammad al-Qa'im (d. 1517 CE) was recognized as leader of the tribes of the Sous valley. He moved his base to Afughal, the burial place of Al-Jazuli, in 1513 CE. After al-Qa'im's death in 1517 CE, his realm was divided between his sons Ahmad al-'Araj (d. 1555 CE) and Muhammad al-Shaykh (d. 1557 CE). Ahmad al-'Araj took control of Marrakesh by 1524 or 1525 CE. The Wattasids formally recognized Saadian rule over southern Morocco through the Treaty of Tadla in 1527 CE. Saadian forces defeated the Wattasid army at Wadi al-'Abid in 1536 CE. Muhammad al-Shaykh achieved a stunning victory by capturing the key Portuguese fortress of Agadir in 1541 CE. In response, Portugal evacuated less defensible positions like Azemmour and Safi, and significantly expanded the fortifications of Mazagan. Muhammad al-Shaykh became sole Saadian ruler in 1543 CE after exiling his brother Ahmad al-'Araj. Saadian forces conquered Fez in 1549 CE, ending Wattasid rule and unifying Morocco under Saadian authority. Muhammad al-Shaykh refused to accept Ottoman suzerainty in 1552 CE, asserting independent Moroccan sovereignty. Although 'Ali Abu Hassun, with Ottoman help, briefly retook Fez in January 1554 CE, Muhammad al-Shaykh conquered Fez again in September 1554 CE, definitively ending Wattasid rule. Muhammad al-Shaykh negotiated an agreement with Count Alcaudete (governor of Spanish Oran) for Spanish anti-Ottoman alliance in 1555 CE. Saadian forces occupied Tlemcen in 1556 CE. Muhammad al-Shaykh was assassinated by an Ottoman agent in 1557 CE.

Abdallah al-Ghalib (r. 1557–1574 CE) succeeded his assassinated father, Muhammad al-Shaykh. He unsuccessfully besieged the Portuguese in Mazagan in 1561 and 1562 CE. In 1564 CE, Spanish troops captured the Ottoman base on Peñon de Vélez. Muhammad II al-Mutawakkil (d. 1578 CE) was a deposed Saadian sultan who sought help from Portugal. King Sebastian I of Portugal (r. 1557–1578 CE) invaded Morocco in June 1578 CE with a large army to restore al-Mutawakkil. Abd al-Malik (d. 1578 CE), uncle of al-Mutawakkil, overthrew him with Ottoman support and took Fez in 1576 CE. On August 4, 1578 CE, Saadian forces, led by Abd al-Malik and his brother Ahmad, inflicted a heavy defeat on the Portuguese at the **Battle of Ksar el-Kebir (Battle of the Three Kings)**, where King Sebastian, al-Mutawakkil, and Abd al-Malik all died. Ahmad al-Mansur (r. 1578–1603 CE), brother of Abd al-Malik, became sultan, initiating the golden age of the Saadian dynasty, marked by immense wealth, astute diplomacy, and military strength.

During Ahmad al-Mansur's reign, Portugal united with Spain in 1580 CE, making Portuguese outposts on the Moroccan coast Spanish possessions. Al-Mansur received a Spanish embassy favorably in 1579 CE, leading to strained relations with the Ottomans, whose symbol of suzerainty he reportedly trampled in 1581 CE. However, he was forced to agree to Ottoman "protection" and pay tribute in 1582 CE to stop Algerian corsair attacks. Saadian forces conquered the Touat oases in 1583 CE. Tensions with the Saadians decreased after the death of Ottoman Grand Admiral Uluç (d. 1587 CE) and changes in Ottoman administration in Algiers, leading Al-Mansur to stop regular payments to Murad III. In 1591 CE, Al-Mansur launched a successful invasion of the Songhai Empire, resulting in the Battle of Tondibi and the defeat of Songhai.

After Ahmad al-Mansur's death in 1603 CE, a civil war erupted among his sons for succession, leading to fragmentation of the Saadian realm. Marrakesh changed hands frequently between 1606 and 1609 CE. Al-Ma'mun, a Saadian prince, sought refuge in Spain in March 1608 CE. Moulay Zaydan (r. 1609–1627 CE), another son of Al-Mansur, recaptured Marrakesh in 1609 CE with Ottoman, English, and Dutch weapons. He later became the sole reunified Saadian ruler. Abdallah al-Ghalib II, son of Al-Ma'mun, also claimed the throne and held Marrakesh. Al-Ma'mun ceded Larache to Spain in 1610 CE in a desperate bid for aid, shattering Saadian credibility. 'Ali Abu Hassun al-Simlali (leader in the Sous valley from 1614 CE) conquered the Dra'a Valley and Sijilmasa.

In 1609 CE, Morisco exiles in Salé and Rabat founded the **Republic of Bou Regreg**, which became a major piracy base. This Republic allied with Muhammad al-'Ayyashi, a religious warrior and governor, in 1615 CE. Jan Jansz (Murat Rais), a former Dutch privateer, became a corsair captain in Salé after his capture in 1618 CE. He led corsair expeditions into the English Channel in 1622 CE and to Iceland in 1627 CE, and the Sack of Baltimore in Ireland in 1631 CE. Internal fighting returned to the Republic of Salé in 1636 CE, with English intervention, and English ships bombarded the Kasbah in 1637 CE. The Republic of Salé fell under the control of the Dilaites in 1640 CE. Ahmad al-Abbas (d. 1659 CE), the last Saadian sultan, was assassinated in 1659 CE, ending the Saadian dynasty.

The **Alaouite Dynasty** began to rise in Tafilalt in 1631 CE when Mawlay al-Sharif (d. 1659 CE), the head of the Alaouite family, was declared leader to defend against the Dala'iyya brotherhood. The Alaouite Dynasty was formally established in 1666 CE. Moulay al-Rashid (r. 1666–1672 CE) founded the Alaouite Sultanate and conquered Marrakesh in 1668 CE. Mawlay Ismail (r. 1672–1727 CE), brother of al-Rashid, consolidated the Alaouite state, created the *Abid al-Bukhari* professional army, and moved the capital to Meknes. Sidi Mohammed III (r. 1757–1790 CE) was an Alaouite sultan known for encouraging European trade. Mawlay Sulayman (r. 1792–1822 CE) imposed restrictions on commercial activities with Europeans, leading to rural revolts in 1819 and 1820 CE, which found support in Fez due to his policies. Riots erupted in Fez in 1820 CE, and Ibrahim, son of Yazid, was proclaimed sultan. Mawlay Sulayman was defeated and captured near Marrakesh in 1822 CE. His nephew, Mawlay Abderrahman (r. 1822-1859 CE), succeeded him and enthusiastically encouraged commerce with Europe. Sidi Mohammed (later Muhammad IV, r. 1859-1873 CE), son of Mawlay Abderrahman, led Moroccan troops against the French at Oued Isly in 1844 CE.

**European influence** intensified in the 19th century. The French occupied Oujda in July 1844 CE and bombarded Tangier and Essaouira in August 1844 CE, leading to a Moroccan defeat at the Battle of Oued Isly. Spanish troops occupied the Chafarinas islands in 1848 CE. The Spanish-Moroccan War began in 1859 CE over a minor border incident near Melilla, with Spanish troops taking Tetuan in February 1860 CE. A rebellion in Fez was sparked in 1873 CE by Madani Bennis buying the right to collect the *maks* gates tax. Mahammad Bayruk built a trading station at Tarfaya in 1878 CE in partnership with Donald Mackenzie, seeking European support. Mawlay Hassan led expeditions to the Sous in 1882 and 1886 CE, forcing Mackenzie out of Tarfaya. The Spanish occupied Villa Cisneros (Dakhla) in 1886 CE. Mawlay Hassan led a Tafilalt expedition in 1893 CE due to French advances in the Sahara. Rebellions such as the Rehamna rebellion in Marrakesh (1895 CE) and the Misfioua rebellion in the Atlas Mountains (1899 CE) also occurred. Ba Ahmad, the effective ruler of Morocco, died in May 1900 CE, and the young Sultan Mawlay Abdul Aziz took control.

Between 1903 and 1907 CE, Morocco experienced famine and insurrections led by El-Rogui (Bou Hmara) and Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni. Muhammad bin Abd al-Kabir al-Kittani (d. 1909 CE) called for jihad in 1905 CE, finding support among artisans and the urban poor. Riots erupted in Casablanca in June 1907 CE after French engineers extended a railway through a graveyard, leading to French bombardment and occupation. French troops also occupied Oujda in retaliation for the murder of a French doctor in Marrakesh. The **Hafidiya Civil War** saw Abd al-Hafid (r. 1908-1912 CE) wrest the throne from his brother Abd al-Aziz (r. 1894-1908 CE). Rebellions erupted in the Middle Atlas in January 1911 CE, and Mawlay Zein, another brother of the sultan, was proclaimed in Meknès. Rebels besieged Fez in May 1911 CE. The **Agadir Incident** in July 1911 CE saw the German cruiser *Panther* sent to Agadir, bringing Europe to the brink of war.

The **French Protectorate** was established by the **Treaty of Fez** on March 30, 1912 CE, which Mawlay Abdelhafid was obliged to sign, transferring executive power to the French. Hubert Lyautey (1854-1934) became the first French Resident General (1912-1925), implementing "indirect rule". Morocco was under French and Spanish colonial rule from 1912 to 1956 CE. Mawlay Yussef (r. 1912-1927 CE) was the sultan chosen by Lyautey after Abdelhafid's abdication. The first Berber Dahir, establishing a separate legal system for Berbers, was issued in September 1914 CE. Between 1880 and 1930 CE, French ethnographers produced the "Moroccan colonial archive," which was a "formidable intellectual achievement" but marked by Orientalism.

**Nationalist sentiment** grew. Modernist Moroccans established the first "Free School" in Fez in 1921 CE to provide Islamic education in Arabic. Abdelkrim el-Khattabi (c. 1882–1963) led a fierce resistance against Spanish and French forces in the Rif War. El Raisuni disbanded his forces in August 1922 CE. Fighting occurred in Tache de Taza and the Middle Atlas in 1923 CE. A cell of the Zawiya secret society was established in Tetuan in 1924 CE. The Spanish army retreated from Chaouen in October and December 1924 CE, and El Raisuni died in April 1925 CE as Rifi forces occupied Chaouen. Rifi forces attacked the French Protectorate in April 1925 CE, advancing near Fez. Lyautey resigned in October 1925 CE after Marshal Petain took overall command of the French army. A huge amphibious operation landed Spanish troops near Alhucemas in September 1925 CE.

The **Berber Dahir** in 1930 CE, codifying customary law in Berber areas, sparked a massive nationalist protest movement. Nationalist leaders set up the secret society, Zawiya, with branches in many Moroccan cities. The first nationalist newspaper, *L’Action du Peuple*, was founded in 1932 CE. Abdelkhalek Torres became the nationalist leader in the Spanish Zone in 1935 CE. The Spanish coup, initiating the Spanish Civil War, began in July 1936 CE with the *Ejército de África* in Spanish occupied Morocco. Forty-seven thousand Moroccans had joined the colonial army by 1940 CE when the French government surrendered to the Germans. The **Istiqlal Party** was founded in 1943 CE, providing much of the leadership for the nationalist movement. In January 1944 CE, the Istiqlal Party released a manifesto demanding full independence. The establishment of the UN in 1945 CE, praising universal equality, provided impetus for anti-colonial movements. Sultan Muhammad V (r. 1927–1961 CE) supported the French effort in WWII but later backed the nationalist movement. He delivered a momentous speech in Tangier on April 10, 1947 CE, appealing for independence and territorial unity. Noguès was the French Resident General during WWII. Lalla Aisha, daughter of Sultan Muhammad V, gained popularity for her speeches with uncovered hair. El Glaoui, Pasha of Marrakesh and a "colonial collaborator," died in 1956 CE. The Aix-les-Bains conference was organized by the French government in August 1955 CE.

**Morocco gained independence** in November 1955 CE when Mohammed V returned from exile after an agreement with the French for an independent constitutional monarchy. El Glaoui died in January 1956 CE. The French zone of Morocco became independent in February 1956 CE. King Mohammed V declared Morocco's independence on March 2, 1956 CE. Spanish authorities returned the northern and southern zones of their Protectorate to Morocco in April 1956 CE. Si Bekkaï, former Pasha of Sefrou, became the first Prime Minister. Mohammed El Mokri (1860-1957), long-serving Grand Vizier, was not involved in the government after independence. Generals Ben Hammou Kettani and Mohammed Ben Mizian, high-ranking Moroccan soldiers in the French and Spanish armies respectively, joined the new Moroccan army.

Under **King Hassan II** (r. 1961–1999 CE), who succeeded his father Mohammed V in 1961 CE, Morocco experienced significant developments. A rebellion in the Rif in 1958 CE was crushed by Crown Prince Hassan. Ben Barka formed the Union National des Forces Populaires (UNFP), a socialist party, in February 1959 CE. Prince Hassan negotiated the end of American bases in Morocco in late 1959 CE. An earthquake destroyed Agadir in February 1960 CE. King Mohammed V sacked the UNFP government in May 1960 CE and appointed his son as minister of defense and deputy prime minister. Hassan II proclaimed Morocco's first constitution on November 18, 1962 CE, which was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum in December 1962 CE despite opposition boycotts. Major Mohammed Oufkir (d. 1972 CE) was aide-de-camp to Mohammed V and later a general. His family, including daughter Malika Oufkir, was imprisoned after his failed coup attempt. The **Hassan II Prize for Manuscripts and Archival Documents** was established in 1969 CE to collect indigenous records. Abdallah Laroui's *History of the Maghrib: An Interpretive Essay*, challenging conventional historical paradigms, was published in 1970 CE. Hassan II's Moroccanization policies in 1973 CE led to the departure of many Europeans. The **Polisario Front (PF)** was formed in 1973 CE, aiming for an independent Western Sahara. Spain withdrew from Western Sahara in 1975 CE. The **Saharan Arab Democratic Republic** was declared by POLISARIO in February 1976 CE. King Hassan II became chairman of the Committee for the Liberation of Jerusalem in 1979 CE. POLISARIO inflicted damage on Moroccan troops in 1980 CE. Rains failed in Casablanca in the winter of 1980-81 CE, leading to riots in May 1981 CE over price increases. The Moroccan defensive wall (Berm) was built across the desert in 1982 CE. The leadership of the Muslim student movement was arrested in 1984 CE. POLISARIO guerrillas were excluded from the former Spanish territory by new walls in 1985 CE. The collapse of the USSR in September 1990 CE reduced US interest in supporting dictatorial states. Unions called a strike in December 1990 CE, which turned into riots. GDP per capita was $1227 in 1997 CE, with half the population living on less than one dollar a day.

Upon the death of **King Hassan II** in July 1999 CE, **Mohammed VI** (r. 1999–present) became king. Sporadic demonstrations against the Moroccan government occurred in Laâyoune in October 1999 CE. Shaykh Yasin, Islamist leader of Al-Adl wal-Ihsan, was released in May 2000 CE. Former prisoners protested outside their closed prison in October 2000 CE. Islamists were arrested again in February 2001 CE. POLISARIO rejected James Baker's new plan in June 2001 CE for not including an initial referendum. Around a quarter of a million Moroccans were working legally in Spain in July 2001 CE. POLISARIO organized brief armed clashes in November 2001 CE. A new family code (Mudawana) was passed in 2004 CE. The **Moroccan Equity and Reconciliation Commission** was established in 2004 CE to document human rights abuses between 1956 and 1999, and its report was published in 2005 CE. The **Amazigh language** was incorporated into the constitution in 2011 CE. During the uprisings of 2011 CE, King Mohammed VI promised sweeping constitutional reforms for a more robust separation of powers and an independent judiciary. The **Archives du Maroc**, the first national post-colonial archives, opened in 2013 CE, 55 years after independence. The Right to Information Law (31.13) was ratified in February 2018 CE.

In recent years, Moroccan authorities dismantled an IS-affiliated cell in April 2021 CE. Organic Law 04-21, changing parliamentary seat calculation, was proposed and endorsed by most political parties in March 2021 CE. Omar Radi, a journalist, was sentenced to six years in prison for espionage and rape in July 2021 CE. Soulaimane Raissouni, another journalist, was sentenced to five years for sexual assault. Social media commentators Chafik Omerani and Saida El Alami were sentenced to prison for criticizing the government. Parliamentary elections in September 2021 CE saw the victory of the National Rally of Independents (RNI), the Party of Authenticity and Modernity (PAM), and the Istiqlal Party (PI). Aziz Akhannouch, leader of the RNI, became head of government. A defamation campaign against Mohamed Ziane was launched in November 2021 CE. In April 2022 CE, 79 persons were charged or convicted for publicly eating during Ramadan. Morocco’s Competition Council released a report detailing unfair competition practices in the fuel market in October 2022 CE. Moroccan authorities dismantled a terrorist cell in Nador and Melilla and arrested five suspected terrorists linked to IS in October 2022 CE. Mohamed Ziane (born c. 1941), former minister for human rights, was arrested without a judicial warrant and sentenced to three years in prison in November 2022 CE for criticizing the government. Justice Minister Abdellatif Ouahbi threatened to strip associations of the right to file complaints against elected officials.

A prominent **mythological figure** is **Aicha Kandicha**, a jinn-like female entity widespread in the Doukkala region, depicted as a beautiful woman with hoofed legs who seduces men. Local historians like Ali Risouni and Fatima Bouchmal have provided insights into figures like Sayyida al-Hurra. Fatima Bouchmal, who wrote information for the qasbah museum signs in 2011, attributes the lack of historical records on women leaders to societal attitudes.

In 1552, Morocco was politically fragmented, defined by a tripartite struggle between the declining **Wattasid dynasty**, the rising **Saadian dynasty**, and fortified **Portuguese coastal enclaves**. The Wattasids, ruling from Fez, were militarily weak and had pursued appeasement with Iberian Christian kingdoms, eroding their legitimacy and confining their control mainly to northern territories. In contrast, the Saadians, a Sharifian family from the Sous valley, galvanized a *jihad* (holy war) against the Portuguese occupiers, uniting southern tribes. Their military victories, particularly the capture of Agadir in 1541, established them as national heroes and defenders of Islam. By 1552, the Saadians, under Muhammad al-Shaykh, had made Marrakesh their capital (since 1524\) and conquered the Wattasid capital of Fez in 1549, effectively ending the old dynasty's rule. Although the Wattasids would attempt an Ottoman-backed recapture of Fez in 1554, their power was broken by 1552\. This conflict led to a formal partition, initially recognized by the 1527 Treaty of Tadla, which divided Morocco along the Oum Er-Rbia River, with Wattasids in the north and Saadians in the south. Even after Fez's fall, Saadian authority was still consolidating, leaving Morocco as a patchwork of shifting allegiances with profound economic consequences, preventing a single national economy and creating regional economic spheres.

The third power was the **Kingdom of Portugal**, which maintained a string of heavily fortified coastal enclaves, or *presidios*, functioning as independent city-states. Following the loss of Agadir in 1541, Portugal focused resources on key strongholds like Tangier, Ceuta, and Mazagan (present-day El Jadida). The fortress of Mazagan, in the Doukkala plains, was massively expanded between 1541 and 1548 into a state-of-the-art Renaissance military fortress with star-shaped bastions. These enclaves were also *feitorias* (commercial warehouses) designed to dominate maritime trade, representing a distinct economic system that interacted complexly with the Moroccan hinterland. Thus, a Doukkala resident in 1552 navigated a crossroads of three competing powers, each with its own economic interests, currency, and political agenda.

The political divisions were mirrored in the economy, with the Saadian-Wattasid conflict being an economic war between two systems: the Saadians controlled dynamic, high-value trade routes in the south, while the Wattasids presided over an increasingly isolated northern agrarian economy. The agrarian core of the Moroccan economy, particularly in the fertile Doukkala and Chaouïa coastal plains, was based on rain-fed cereal production (wheat and barley) and livestock (cattle, sheep, goats), providing food, wool, and hides. The social structure was predominantly tribal, a mix of indigenous Berber and Arab groups. The **Saadian ascendancy was financed by their control of trans-Saharan trade routes** in the south, linking Morocco to West African empires for gold, ivory, slaves, and crucially, salt. This trade provided immense wealth, enabling the Saadians to purchase modern firearms and artillery from European traders, a decisive military advantage that the Wattasids lacked.

Morocco faced a **monetary crisis** in the mid-16th century, primarily due to currency debasement and foreign coins (Spanish and Portuguese) flooding the market. The traditional monetary system included the gold *mithqal* and silver *uqiyyahs*. This created a chaotic, multi-currency environment and inflation, damaging the less fortunate. Money changers were essential for assessing the value of various coins. A historical misconception is that Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur initiated Morocco's sugar industry; in fact, the foundations were laid earlier. Early Saadian leader Muhammad al-Shaykh actively promoted sugarcane cultivation and sugar export from the Sous valley, making it the region's primary export by the late 1540s and early 1550s. This sugar was traded for European cloth and saltpeter (for gunpowder), funding the Saadian war effort in 1552\.

The **souk (marketplace)** was the vibrant heart of Moroccan economic and social life, functioning as a "frontier market" in Doukkala where conflict and commerce intertwined. Souks were organized by craft or commodity, with specific alleys for artisans like blacksmiths (*souk haddadine*), leatherworkers (*souk cherratine*), and spice merchants (*souk el attarine*). Doukkala markets offered local agricultural bounty: wheat, barley, bread, vegetables, pulses, olives, figs, nuts, live animals (sheep, goats, chickens), meat, dairy, eggs, raw wool, hides, and fresh/salted fish. Artisans sold hand-woven textiles (djellabas, hendiras), Berber rugs, leather goods (babouches, bags), pottery (tagines, serving dishes), and metalware. Goods from afar, crucial for broader trade networks, included Saharan salt, dates from southern oases, and spices (cumin, cinnamon, saffron). More cosmopolitan markets might also feature luxury goods from trans-Saharan routes like elephant ivory, exotic woods, and ostrich feathers.

In 1552, there was no single, unified currency in Morocco; the **Wattasid Sultanate, Saadian Sultanate, and Portuguese enclaves each minted their own coins**. The Wattasids in the north minted square silver *dirhams* (full, half, third, quarter denominations) and copper *falus*. The Saadians in the south issued their own silver *dirhams* and half *dirhams*, stylistically distinct from Wattasid ones, primarily for paying soldiers and funding expansion, as their gold *dinars* came later. The currencies were not officially interchangeable, but de facto circulation occurred in frontier zones like Doukkala, relying on money changers to establish fluctuating exchange rates based on silver content and political fortunes. Foreign coins further complicated the multi-currency environment. **Barter** remained a fundamental part of the economy, especially in rural areas, offering a hedge against inflation. High-demand goods like salt, cloth, or iron bars also functioned as commodity currencies. Portuguese enclaves used their *réis* (silver, copper) and *cruzados* (gold, silver).

**Trade with the Portuguese at Mazagan** was contradictory: official *jihad* rhetoric from the Saadians coexisted with local commercial interchange driven by survival and profit. Fortresses like Mazagan depended on the Moroccan hinterland for food, leading the Portuguese to cultivate relationships with local "Moors of Peace" (*Mouros de paz*) who supplied goods in defiance of the Saadian resistance. Moroccans supplied Mazagan with wheat, barley, meat, vegetables, horses, local textiles, hides, and wool. In return, the Portuguese offered European manufactured goods, notably high-quality cloth. Ironically, European weaponry (firearms, cannons, gunpowder) was also clandestinely imported and acquired by Moroccan forces, sometimes from English or French traders, and then used against the Portuguese themselves. Transactions involved a mix of Portuguese *réis*, Moroccan *dirhams* (Wattasid or Saadian), and direct barter, especially for certainty in volatile currency markets.

The social perception of Moroccans who traded with the Portuguese was not uniform. For *Mouros de paz* who formally allied with the Portuguese, trading was a treaty obligation and a survival strategy. Independent merchants, including Jewish traders, viewed it as economic opportunism. However, the Saadian state and religious leaders (marabouts) branded any Moroccan aiding the enemy as a **traitor**, as their movement was built on unified Muslim resistance. The economic and political dynamics of 1552 were not a permanent decline but a "crucible" for a new, powerful Moroccan state. Saadian control of trans-Saharan gold, their early sugar industry, and their use of this wealth for a modern army with firearms were foundations for their future success. This period set the stage for the country's unification under Muhammad al-Shaykh in 1554, the victory at Alcácer Quibir in 1578, and the "Golden Age" of Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur.

Moroccan history is a rich tapestry woven from threads of faith, ambition, tribal loyalty, and geopolitical struggle, reflecting a dynamic narrative of unification and fragmentation. Situated at the westernmost edge of the Islamic world, the Maghrib al-Aqsa, or "Far West," has served as both a sanctuary and a crossroads, a bastion of independence and a prize for empires. This report provides a chronological and territorial analysis of its ruling houses, from the foundational Idrisid dynasty to the enduring Alaouite monarchy of the present day. To fully comprehend this history, understanding its geography and the shifting borders and spheres of influence under each dynasty, including the unique administrative division between government-controlled lands (*Bled el-Makhzen*) and autonomous tribal territories (*Bled es-Siba*), is crucial. The tumultuous 16th century, a pivotal era of profound social, economic, and political transformations, is framed through the eyes of a fictional character, Zaynab bint Yusuf, an Andalusian refugee, to bring this period to life.

The **Idrisid dynasty** (788–974) marked the birth of the first autonomous Islamic state in Morocco, emerging from the political vacuum left by the Great Berber Revolt of 740-743 CE, which had successfully ended direct Umayyad and Abbasid rule but resulted in fragmentation. **Idris ibn Abdallah**, a *sharif* (descendant of the Prophet Muhammad) and political refugee, arrived in Volubilis in 788 and was welcomed by the Awraba Berber tribe, who recognized his noble lineage as a source of legitimacy to unite the region. This established a potent political model based on Sharifian descent that would later be successfully revived by the Saadian and Alaouite dynasties. Idris I's reign was cut short in 791 when he was poisoned, but his posthumous son, **Idris II** (r. 791–828), born to an Awraba Berber mother, continued his father's work. Idris II proved to be a visionary state-builder, founding the city of **Fez** on the banks of the Oued Fes in 808-809, which rapidly grew into the political, economic, and religious heart of the kingdom, fostering the Arabization of the urban population. At its zenith, the Idrisid state stretched from western Algeria to the Sous valley, establishing itself as the preeminent power over rival principalities like Nekor, Barghawata, and Sijilmasa. However, the unity proved ephemeral. After Idris II's death in 828, his son **Muhammad ibn Idris** (r. 828–836) divided the kingdom among seven of his brothers, creating a federation of eight autonomous statelets, which shattered centralized power and led to decades of internal rivalries. By the early 10th century, the weakened Idrisid statelets became pawns between the powerful Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba and the ambitious Fatimid Caliphate from Ifriqiya. The Fatimids, with their Miknasa Berber allies, drove the Idrisids from Fez in 921, and the last Idrisid ruler was captured and executed by the Umayyads in 985, bringing the dynasty to an end. The territorial representation of the Idrisid realm shows a unified interior under Idris II, which later fragmented into multiple smaller principalities.

The collapse of the Idrisids ushered in a century of fragmentation, dominated by Zenata Berber tribes, until the dramatic rise of two successive Berber empires: the **Almoravids** and the **Almohads**. The **Almoravid movement** (1040–1147) originated in the Saharan desert among the Lamtuna and Gudala tribes of the Sanhaja Berber confederation. Their spiritual leader, **Abdallah ibn Yasin** (r. 1040–1059), established a *ribat* to instill strict Maliki Islamic doctrine and martial discipline in his followers, known as *al-Murabitun* (Almoravids). Under the military leadership of **Yusuf ibn Tashfin** (r. 1072–1106), this religious fervor was channeled into conquest. They swept north, conquering Morocco's southern oases and plains, and in 1062, Yusuf ibn Tashfin founded **Marrakesh**, which became their new imperial capital. By 1082, they had subjugated all of Morocco and extended their empire eastward into western Algeria. In 1085, the Christian king Alfonso VI of Castile captured Toledo, prompting the *Taifa* kingdoms of al-Andalus to appeal to Yusuf ibn Tashfin for aid. In 1086, Yusuf inflicted a crushing defeat on Castilian forces at the **Battle of Sagrajas (al-Zallaqah)**, halting the Christian *Reconquista* for a generation. By 1090, he deposed the *Taifa* kings and annexed al-Andalus to his African empire, uniting the Maghreb and Islamic Spain under a single political authority for the first time. The Almoravid empire at its greatest extent (c. 1120\) created a vast, unified political space stretching from the northern banks of the Senegal and Niger rivers to most of modern Spain and Portugal, shifting the region's center of gravity from Córdoba and Kairouan to Marrakesh.

The **Almohad movement** (1121–1269) followed, representing the zenith of Berber power. Founded by **Ibn Tumart** (r. 1121–1130), a religious scholar from the Masmuda Berber confederation in the High Atlas mountains, who preached a radical doctrine of absolute divine unity (*Tawhid*) and declared himself the *Mahdi*. After Ibn Tumart's death, his successor, **Abd al-Mu'min** (r. 1133–1163), transformed the movement into an unstoppable military force, capturing the Almoravid capital of Marrakesh in 1147\. Abd al-Mu'min embarked on breathtaking expansion, conquering the entire Maghreb from the Atlantic coast of Morocco to Tripoli in modern Libya by 1159, and by 1172, his successors had brought all of Muslim al-Andalus under their control. The Almohad Caliphate was the largest empire ever ruled from Morocco, a dominant power in the western Mediterranean. The reigns of **Abu Yaqub Yusuf I** (r. 1163–1184) and **Yaqub al-Mansur** (r. 1184–1199) marked the apogee of Almohad power and culture, patrons of philosophy and commissioning magnificent architectural masterpieces like the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakesh and its sister minaret, the Giralda, in Seville. Al-Mansur's victory over the Castilians at the Battle of Alarcos in 1195 seemed to reaffirm Almohad military supremacy. However, in 1212, al-Mansur's successor, **Muhammad al-Nasir** (r. 1199–1213), suffered a decisive defeat at the **Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa** against a coalition of Christian kingdoms, a catastrophe from which the Almohads never recovered. Their authority in al-Andalus crumbled, and the empire disintegrated in North Africa as peripheral dynasties like the Hafsids, Zayyanids, and Marinids rose. The last Almohad caliph, **Idris II al-Wathiq** (r. 1266–1269), was killed in Marrakesh in 1269 by the ascendant Marinids. The Almoravids and Almohads facilitated a profound cultural exchange, with Andalusian art, architecture, literature, and administrative practices deeply enriching Moroccan civilization.

As the Almohad empire crumbled, the **Marinids** (1244–1465), a nomadic tribe of Zenata Berber origin, rose to power. They captured Meknes, Salé, and Rabat, seized Fez in 1244, and ultimately conquered Marrakesh in 1269 under **Abu Yusuf Yaqub** (r. 1258–1286), ending Almohad rule definitively and becoming the first Marinid Sultan. Unlike their predecessors, Marinid legitimacy was primarily military and political, focused on restoring order and continuing the *jihad* in Spain. The Marinid era is remembered as a golden age of art, architecture, and intellectual life in their capital, Fez. Their most distinctive contribution was the establishment of the *madrasa* (theological college), such as the Bou Inania (1351-56) and Al-Attarine (1323-25) in Fez, which are masterpieces of Hispano-Moorish style. These madrasas were a political strategy to create a loyal elite of scholars and bureaucrats dependent on the state, counterbalancing rural marabouts and tribal leaders. Despite their cultural brilliance, the Marinid state was chronically unstable after the death of **Sultan Abu Inan Faris** (r. 1348–1358). Real power shifted to their viziers, particularly from the related Wattasid tribe. External pressures, including the Portuguese capture of Ceuta in 1415, eroded their prestige. The last Marinid sultan, **Abd al-Haqq II** (r. 1420–1465), was murdered in a revolt in Fez in 1465, bringing the dynasty to an end. The Marinid Sultanate (c. 1360\) primarily centered on modern Morocco, marking a contraction of centralized power compared to its imperial predecessors.

The 16th century in Morocco was a period of intense conflict and transformation. Zaynab bint Yusuf, an Andalusian refugee in Fez, would witness the decline of the **Wattasid dynasty** in the north and the rise of the **Saadian dynasty** in the south. In Zaynab's youth (1505-1554), the Wattasid sultans in Fez held diminishing power, barely extending beyond the northern plains and widely seen as ineffective against the growing Portuguese threat along the Atlantic coast. Meanwhile, the **Saadians**, a Sharifian family from the Sous and Draa river valleys, emerged as a powerful force. Their legitimacy stemmed from their descent from the Prophet (*shurafa*) and their declaration of a *jihad* against the Portuguese, contrasting with Wattasid appeasement policies. Led by **Muhammad al-Qa'im** and his sons, **Ahmad al-Araj** and **Muhammad al-Shaykh**, the Saadians rapidly gained power, capturing Marrakesh in 1524 and making it their capital. The 1527 Treaty of Tadla formalized the country's division, with Wattasids ruling the north from Fez and Saadians the south from Marrakesh. Saadian prestige soared in 1541 when **Muhammad al-Shaykh** captured the key Portuguese fortress of Agadir, proving them to be the true defenders of Islam. With popular support, the Saadians marched north, capturing Fez in 1549\. The last Wattasid sultan, **Ali Abu Hassun** (r. 1554), made a desperate, Ottoman-backed attempt to regain power in 1554 but was defeated and killed, extinguishing the Wattasid dynasty and uniting Morocco under **Muhammad al-Shaykh**. This period was marked by a fragmented political landscape, also including Portuguese coastal enclaves and the Principality of Debdou.

After the final victory over the Wattasids in 1554, Zaynab and her family moved to the vibrant new capital of Marrakesh, witnessing the consolidation of a unified Saadian state under **Sultan Mohammed ash-Sheikh** and later **Abdallah al-Ghalib** (r. 1557–1574). However, a larger threat emerged from the powerful Ottoman Empire to the east, which saw Morocco as a rival and launched direct invasions in 1557 and 1558, briefly occupying Fez. This confrontation forced a profound **military transformation** in Morocco, as Saadian sultans modernized their forces by adopting Ottoman-style organization, hiring Turkish and European renegade instructors, and emphasizing firearms. This allowed Morocco to successfully repel the Ottoman threat and maintain its sovereignty, making it the only Arab nation in North Africa to remain independent of Istanbul's rule, and forging a distinct Moroccan national identity. Saadian society was a tapestry of diverse cultures, with the ruling family's Sharifian lineage at its apex, supported by religious families, Sufi masters, merchants, artisans, and a vital Jewish community. Women's lives varied, from urban women in harems to figures like **Sayyida al-Hurra**, the powerful female governor of Tétouan who commanded a pirate fleet and negotiated with European kings. The Saadian economy was robust and multifaceted, based on revitalized trans-Saharan trade for West African gold, salt, ivory, and slaves, and a large-scale sugar industry in southern Morocco, particularly around Taroudant, which relied heavily on slave labor. The wealth from trade and conquest fueled a great architectural revival, continuing the elegant Hispano-Moorish style with grandeur, seen in the expansion and redecoration of the Ben Youssef Madrasa in Marrakesh.

In her old age (1578), Zaynab would witness the events leading to the **Battle of the Three Kings**. After the death of Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib in 1574, his son, **Abu Abdallah Muhammad al-Mutawakkil** (r. 1574–1576), was challenged and overthrown by his uncle, **Abd al-Malik** (r. 1576–1578), who returned from exile with Ottoman military backing. Desperate, al-Mutawakkil appealed to the young Portuguese King **Sebastian I**, who, dreaming of a crusade, agreed to invade Morocco to restore him in exchange for coastal control. In the summer of 1578, a huge Portuguese armada landed at Asilah. The two armies converged near Ksar el-Kebir: King Sebastian's force of nearly 20,000, including Portuguese nobility and European mercenaries, was strong in infantry but hampered by a large baggage train. Sultan Abd al-Malik's army of around 50,000 combined traditional Moroccan cavalry with professional infantry armed with modern arquebuses, many Turkish-trained. On August 4, 1578, the Moroccan army's superior numbers and mobility enveloped the slower-moving Portuguese square, turning the battle into a rout and slaughter. In the chaos, King Sebastian, al-Mutawakkil, and Sultan Abd al-Malik all died, giving the battle its famous name. **Ahmad al-Mansur** (r. 1578–1603), Abd al-Malik's brother, was proclaimed the new sultan. The victory was monumental for Morocco, ending the threat of Portuguese colonization, securing independence, and flooding the treasury with gold from ransoms, funding a subsequent "Golden Age". For Portugal, it was a national trauma that led to a severe succession crisis and its absorption into a personal union with Spain under the **Iberian Union** for 60 years.

The reign of **Ahmad al-Mansur** (1578–1603) is remembered as the golden age of the Saadian dynasty, characterized by unprecedented power and splendor, funded by Portuguese ransoms and astute diplomacy. His court in Marrakesh became legendary for its opulence, exemplified by the construction of the magnificent El Badi Palace. Al-Mansur's most audacious venture was the 1591 invasion of the Songhai Empire in West Africa, which, with a small force armed with modern firearms, shattered the Songhai army at the Battle of Tondibi, giving Morocco direct control over the gold and salt mines of the Niger Bend and earning him the epithet *al-Dhahabi* ("the Golden"). However, al-Mansur's state was highly centralized around his own authority, and he failed to establish a clear line of succession. Upon his death from the plague in 1603, his sons plunged the country into a devastating and protracted **civil war (1603-1627)**, splitting the Saadian realm along a north-south axis with rival sultans in Marrakesh and Fez. This period of *fitna* (strife) led to the complete collapse of central authority, with regional warlords, religious brotherhoods like the powerful Dala'iyya, and even pirate republics like that of Salé, carving out independent domains. The cession of the Atlantic port of Larache to Spain in 1610 by al-Ma'mun in a desperate bid for aid shattered the dynasty's credibility. This anarchy and fragmentation created the power vacuum that allowed for the rise of Morocco's next—and final—dynasty: the Alaouites.

As Saadian power crumbled in the early 17th century, the **Alaouites** (1631–Present), a new Sharifian family, rose to prominence in the pre-Saharan oasis of Tafilalt. In 1631, **Mawlay al-Sharif** (r. 1631–1635), head of the Alaouite family, was declared leader by the people of Tafilalt to defend against the Dala'iyya brotherhood. His sons transformed this local leadership into a national dynasty, with **Mawlay al-Rashid** (r. 1664–1672) emerging as the undisputed leader after sibling rivalry. Al-Rashid reunited the country through military campaigns, defeating the Dala'iyya and capturing Fez in 1666 and Marrakesh in 1668, thus establishing the Alaouite Sultanate. The Alaouite state was consolidated during the long reign of his brother, **Mawlay Ismail** (r. 1672–1727), a ruthless ruler who created a new, powerful professional army known as the *Abid al-Bukhari* (Black Guard) to pacify the country and drive out foreign forces. He moved the capital from Fez to the new imperial city of Meknes, which he transformed with massive construction projects. However, Ismail's death in 1727 plunged Morocco into another period of chaos and civil war (1727-1757) as his many sons contested the succession. Stability was eventually restored under his grandson, **Mohammed III** (r. 1757–1790), who brought the army under control and rebuilt the central administration. The Alaouite dynasty continued to rule an independent Morocco through the 19th century, facing increasing pressure from European colonial powers. This culminated in the **1912 Treaty of Fes**, which established the French and Spanish Protectorates, ending Moroccan sovereignty for 44 years, though the Alaouite sultans were retained as nominal rulers. **Sultan Mohammed V** (r. 1927–1961) became a symbol of the national struggle for freedom, and upon Morocco's return to independence in 1956, the monarchy was restored. In 1957, Mohammed V formally changed his title from Sultan to King, marking the beginning of the modern Moroccan monarchy, which continues to this day under his grandson, **King Mohammed VI** (r. 1999–Present). The Alaouite Sultanate during the pre-colonial period was characterized by two distinct zones: *Bled el-Makhzen* (land of direct government control) and *Bled es-Siba* (land of autonomous tribal regions), a system that defined the Moroccan state until the 20th century.

The year 1552 in Morocco was a period of significant political transformation, marked by the decline of the Wattasid dynasty and the consolidation of power by the ascendant Saadian sharifs. This internal dynamic unfolded against the persistent presence of European colonial enclaves, particularly the formidable Portuguese fortress of Mazagan (El Jadida) on the Atlantic coast.

The **Wattasid dynasty**, a Zenata Berber lineage, ruled from Fez from 1472 until their eventual demise in 1554\. Their reign was characterized by internal strife and external pressures, primarily from Portugal and Spain. A defining failure of Wattasid rule was their inability to protect Morocco's coastal territories from Iberian incursions, leading to the loss of strategic areas. By 1552, Wattasid influence was severely diminished, largely confined to remnants of their northern territories, and their legitimacy was all but spent. The last Wattasid sultan, Abu Hassun, briefly reclaimed Fez with Ottoman help in early 1554 but was permanently defeated by Muhammad al-Shaykh Saadi by September of that year.

In stark contrast, the **Saadian dynasty**, an Arab Sharifian lineage from southern Morocco, rose to prominence as fervent champions of *jihad* against Portuguese expansion, garnering substantial support from Sufi orders and local tribes. A pivotal moment in their rise was the capture of Agadir from the Portuguese in 1541, which triggered the immediate Portuguese evacuation of Azemmour and Safi. This success solidified Saadian legitimacy, and by January 1549, Muhammad al-Shaykh Saadi had conquered Fez, becoming the undisputed ruler of a largely unified Morocco. In 1552, the Saadians had largely cemented their control, rejecting an Ottoman diplomatic overture for nominal suzerainty, which underscored their ambition for independent, sovereign rule. Despite their successes, Mazagan remained a heavily fortified Portuguese enclave, posing an enduring strategic and military challenge to the newly unified Saadian state.

**Mazagan**, today known as El Jadida, was a critical Portuguese fortified colony on Morocco's Atlantic coastline, initially settled in 1502 with a citadel built in 1514\. Following the loss of Agadir in 1541, the Portuguese strategically reinforced Mazagan, transforming it into a formidable, star-shaped fortress between 1541 and 1548\. This ambitious project involved Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish engineers, resulting in a pioneering example of Renaissance military architecture in Africa. Its robust fortifications, including bastions, inclined ramparts, and a massive underground cistern, allowed it to withstand numerous sieges, notably a major assault in 1562\. The fortress, housing approximately 4,000 individuals and four churches, served as a vital base for controlling maritime gold and spice trade routes.

The **Doukkala region**, inland from Mazagan, was a vibrant agricultural heartland in the 16th century. It was historically home to a diverse confederation of Amazigh (Berber) tribes, with significant Arab migrations leading to cultural intermingling. The tribal structure was often organized into "khams khmas" ("five fifths") for tax collection and military conscription. The extended family served as the fundamental social and economic unit, though seclusion for women was less strictly applied in rural areas than in urban or elite contexts due to economic necessity. Rural society exhibited a clear social hierarchy, with influential saintly families (marabouts or *shurafa*), wealthy landowners, and local government representatives at the apex, followed by smaller landlords, local chiefs, and minor functionaries, and at the base, propertyless farm laborers (*haratin*) and former Negro slaves. Despite rivalries, a strong sense of community and solidarity, often formalized through tribal contracts overseen by religious centers (Zawaya), prevailed.

Daily life in Doukkala was deeply agrarian, with small, subsistence farms reliant on rainfall, cultivating cereals (wheat, barley), legumes, olives, grapes, figs, and sugar cane. Livestock rearing, particularly sheep and cattle, was also significant. Traditional rural housing included unique dry stone structures called **Tazotas**, found exclusively in the region, and homes typically built around a central courtyard. Nomadic groups used tents. Rural women were indispensable, actively involved in fieldwork, weaving wool, gathering wood, and fetching water, significantly contributing to the household economy. Meals were often communal, eaten by hand from a shared dish. Religious and social celebrations, such as Islamic holidays (Ramadan, Eid Al Adha), marriage customs, and celebrations for a child's first fast or Quran memorization, punctuated the year. Sufi practices, including *dhikr* sessions and prophetic praises, were regularly organized in Zawaya.

Morocco in the 16th century was predominantly Sunni Muslim, adhering to the Maliki rite, with Islam profoundly influencing daily life. **Sufism** was deeply embedded in rural society, providing spiritual framework and social cohesion. Holy men (*murābiṭūn* or marabouts) held immense spiritual influence, possessing *baraka* (blessing) and *karāmāt* (supernatural powers), often linked to shrines at venerated tombs. Popular beliefs and superstitions were also prevalent, including omens associated with household items and the perceived power of objects like agate stones. A prominent mythological figure was **Aicha Kandicha**, a female entity akin to a jinn, widespread in Doukkala. She was typically depicted as a beautiful young woman with hoofed animal legs, residing near water sources, and known for seducing men, leading them to madness or death. A compelling theory connects her to a historical figure from El Jadida (Mazagan) who actively resisted the Portuguese by seducing soldiers, who were then ambushed and killed by Moroccan fighters, transforming her into a powerful symbol of local resistance. Kandicha was associated with specific rituals and offerings like amber, honey, pearls, shells, bread, figs, and olives, with henna and incense used in her honor. Moroccan culture was a rich synthesis of Arab, Berber, and Andalusi influences, further enriched by Mediterranean, Hebraic, and African elements. Traditional clothing like the djellaba was widely worn.

The economic landscape of Doukkala was a dynamic interplay of local agricultural production, traditional crafts, and evolving trade networks, significantly influenced by the Portuguese presence and geopolitical shifts. Local markets, or *souqs*, were fundamental, operating on regular schedules and organized by artisan guilds in larger cities. A diverse array of goods was exchanged, including agricultural products (cereals, legumes, fruits, vegetables, sugar cane), livestock, textiles (wool, silk, djellabas, caftans), spices, perfumes, traditional beauty products (argan oil), handicrafts (pottery, jewelry), and imported goods like firearms and alcohol. While **barter** was common, the use of **money** was widespread, and haggling was integral to trade. Craft production, especially rug weaving by Amazigh women, was a major economic and artistic activity contributing significantly to household incomes. Historically, trans-Saharan trade in gold, ivory, and slaves was a major economic driver, but the 16th century witnessed a strategic shift towards Atlantic coastal trade due to deteriorating security inland, leading to the decline of traditional Moroccan inland trade centers. The **Jewish community** played a crucial role in transit trade, controlling gold markets and specializing in silversmithing, money changing (*sarrafa*), and textile production, primarily residing in urban centers.

The **Portuguese influence on the local economy** was complex and often detrimental. They imposed taxes on farmers, plundered crops and livestock, seized agricultural lands, and actively engaged in the slave trade, capturing Moroccans for forced labor. Despite this, some Moroccans cooperated with the Portuguese in trade, facilitating the exchange of goods. The Portuguese introduced new goods like fabrics, mirrors, knives, firearms, and alcohol, primarily seeking gold in return. The Saadian dynasty, in their struggle against the Portuguese, developed sophisticated economic policies, monopolizing sugar exports and imposing taxes on trans-Saharan trade to fund military campaigns. They also actively sought trade relations with European powers hostile to Portugal (e.g., England, Holland) to acquire firearms. In 1552, there was no single, unified currency in Morocco; the Wattasid Sultanate, Saadian Sultanate, and Portuguese enclaves each minted their own coins (silver *dirhams*, copper *falus*, Portuguese *réis* and *cruzados*), with values fluctuating, and barter remaining fundamental.

The Moroccan public's reaction to the Portuguese occupation ranged from pragmatic accommodation to fervent, religiously motivated resistance. Some segments, particularly in southern regions, initially accepted or even sought Portuguese suzerainty for security or economic gain, with local leaders collaborating. However, a significant majority vehemently rejected the Portuguese presence, rooted in Islamic principles and fueled by economic and social harm. Religious centers (Zawaya) and their influential sheikhs played a pivotal role in mobilizing the populace for *jihad* against the Portuguese, filling the vacuum left by the Wattasid central authority's perceived weakness. This led to the depopulation of coastal cities or their transformation into military garrisons.

The **Wattasid dynasty's failures** in countering invasions and their lack of centralized control led to widespread disillusionment and an erosion of their legitimacy. In contrast, the **Saadians cultivated popular support** by positioning themselves as champions of *jihad* against foreign occupiers, with military successes like the capture of Agadir solidifying their image as national heroes. Their Sharifian lineage (descent from Prophet Muhammad) further bolstered their religious and political authority. While the transition to Saadian rule was not always smooth, with Wattasid attempts to regain control, the Saadians' appropriation of the *jihad* narrative and their military victories directly translated into popular legitimacy. Religious scholars (*ulema*) and Sufi brotherhoods (Zawaya) wielded immense spiritual and political influence, regarded as possessing *baraka* and *karāmāt*. Leaders like Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Jazuli exemplified this, merging divine presence (*walaya*) with worldly authority (*wilaya*). Zawaya became dynamic centers of devotion, learning, and popular mobilization, actively organizing resistance against the Portuguese occupation. Some scholars, such as Ahmad Baba al-Timbukti, even expressed caution against aligning too closely with rulers, advocating for piety and asceticism, and engaging in discussions on legitimacy and governance.

The daily lives of **women in rural Morocco** involved extensive labor and domestic responsibilities, primarily child-rearing, cooking, and household chores. Due to economic necessity, rural women frequently worked outside the home, actively participating in agricultural labor as unpaid farmers, enduring harsh conditions. Craft production, especially rug weaving by Amazigh women (a practice dating back to prehistoric times with distinct tribal designs), was a major economic and artistic activity, with sales contributing significantly to household incomes. They also engaged in embroidery. Daily routines included fetching water and gathering wood. Within households, a hierarchy existed, with married women generally having higher status. While literacy rates were generally low, elite women could own and manage property. Women were crucial in transmitting community traditions and rituals through chanting and poetry, asserting their presence within Islamic traditions. Weavers were believed to possess *baraka* and commanded respect. Historically, some women, like Kenza al-Awrabiya and Zaynab an-Nafzawiyya, exerted political influence, and women served as political leaders and saints. The theory linking Aicha Kandicha to a historical resistance figure from El Jadida highlights the potential for women's direct or symbolic involvement in resistance against Portuguese occupation. Oral traditions were primary forms of female expression and knowledge transmission, preserving cultural and historical narratives outside formal records.

Morocco's history is characterized by deep layers of cultural and political structures, reflecting a complex mix of Arab, Islamic, Berber, and European influences, and the enduring survival of a dynastic system into the post-colonial era. The country's name itself, "Morocco," is derived from the city of Marrakesh, which was founded in the early eleventh century.

Human habitation in Morocco dates back to the Lower Paleolithic period, with early hominids present at least 400,000 years ago in Salé. Early *Homo sapiens* fossils from Jebel Irhoud date back 300,000 years. The earliest cultural structures are influenced by geography, including mountains, rivers, seas, and deserts, which dictated settlement patterns.

Recorded history began with the **Phoenician and Carthaginian periods**. Phoenician traders established settlements along the Moroccan coast, including Lixus (near Larache), Rusaddir (Melilla), and Essaouira, between the 8th and 5th centuries BC. By the 5th century BC, Carthage, located in modern-day Tunisia, had become the pre-eminent Phoenician city and extended its influence westward, establishing trading posts along the North African coast, including Tamuda (near Tetuan), Ksar es-Seghir, and Tingis (Tangier). The Carthaginians also influenced local societies, employing indigenous "Libyans"—early Berbers—as mercenary soldiers and introducing agricultural methods and the Punic language to some areas. Volubilis was a significant inland city with Carthaginian influence but not under Carthaginian rule.

Indigenous Berber kingdoms began to emerge around the 4th century BC. The **Mauri** formed a tribal federation in what is now eastern Morocco, while other kingdoms like the Masaeslyi and Massyli (collectively known as Numidia) developed further east. These kingdoms played a role in the **Punic Wars** between Carthage and Rome, with figures like Masinissa of the Massyli aligning with Rome. Following Carthage's annihilation in 146 BC, Rome initially left most of the former Carthaginian Empire to self-govern, but later crushed the Numidian king Jugurtha. **Mauretania**, an indigenous kingdom in the far west, became a Roman client state under **Juba II** in 25 BC, who oversaw the Romanization of northwest Africa and the development of Volubilis. In 40 AD, Emperor Caligula assassinated Juba II's son Ptolemy, and Mauretania was formally annexed as the province of **Mauretania Tingitana**, with Volubilis as its principal garrison city. Roman occupation was limited to economically useful areas, typically cities like Volubilis, and relied on alliances with local tribes rather than continuous fortifications. The province produced olives, wine, and mineral exports for Rome.

**Christianity** was introduced to Mauretania Tingitana, with the first mention of it appearing in 298 AD through the martyrdom of a centurion named Marcel during Diocletian's persecutions. It spread further in the 4th century, with basilicas built and Roman gods' statues broken in places like Lixus. Roman rule became remote after the dissolution of the Third Augustan Legion in 238 AD and a substantial withdrawal from Mauretania Tingitana in 285 AD, leading to reliance on treaties with local tribes like the **Baqates**, whose leaders were recognized as "Rex" (king) by the Romans. The **Vandals**, a Germanic people adhering to Arianism, invaded North Africa in 429 AD but largely bypassed Mauretania Tingitana, leaving little trace. The **Byzantine Empire** briefly reconquered parts of North Africa in 533 AD under Belisarius, but in the far west, their control was limited to Ceuta and Tangier, though their influence extended to places like Salé and Volubilis, which still preserved Roman culture and Catholic Christianity in the 6th century. By the end of the 7th century, no external power was strong, and north-western Africa awaited new rulers.

The **Islamic expansion** into North Africa began in the early 8th century, bringing the dominant religion of Islam and the Arabic language. After an initial raid, Muslim armies permanently retook Kairouan in 698, which became the capital of the new province of **Ifriqiya**. Musa bin Nusayr extended Muslim rule to the whole of the Maghrib, capturing Ceuta, Tangier, and the coastal regions of the old Roman provinces of Mauritania Caesariensis and Mauritania Tingitana by 710\. However, the **Berbers** presented significant resistance to Muslim armies.

The **Berber Revolt** of 739 or 740, a tax revolt in Tangier led by Maysara, transformed into a **Khariji insurrection**. The Berbers rebelled not against Islam, but against the Arabs who they felt had betrayed their faith, demanding recognition of their status as Muslims. This rebellion spread quickly, leading to the **Battle of the Nobles** in 741, where a large Arab army from Kairouan was decisively defeated. This period saw the emergence of several independent Berber states. The **Barghawata**, a heterodox state with its own distinct religion, emerged on the Atlantic coast. The Midrarid dynasty founded the prosperous **Emirate of Sijilmasa** in the Tafilalt oasis in 757, exploiting the trans-Saharan gold trade. The tiny kingdom of **Nkur** also emerged in the Rif area, apparently an orthodox one. These heterodox states often represented a Berber rather than an Arab expression of Islam, using religion to justify their revolt and cultural identity.

The **Idrisid dynasty** (788–974) marked the first autonomous Islamic state in Morocco. **Idris ibn Abdallah**, a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, fled to Volubilis in 788 and was welcomed by the Awraba Berbers. His son, **Idris II**, born to an Awraba mother, was proclaimed sovereign in 803 and in 809 moved the capital to **Fez**, which he built into a major center of trade and learning. Fez attracted refugees from al-Andalus and Kairouan, including merchants, artisans, and scholars. Religious women played a key role in endowing mosques, such as the Qarawiyyin (859/60), which became a foundational Islamic learning center. The Idrisid state spread from the Rif to the Sous, but after Idris II's death in 829, his son Muhammad divided the state among his six brothers, leading to fragmentation and weakening centralized power. This left the Idrisids vulnerable to the rivalry between the **Fatimids** of Ifriqiya and the **Umayyads** of Córdoba, who vied for control of Morocco, using local tribes and rulers as pawns. The Umayyads eventually gained economic control, and the Idrisid dynasty formally ended in 985\.

The 11th century saw the rise of the **Almoravid dynasty** (1040–1147), which unified the fragmented Maghrib. Originating among the Sanhaja Berber tribes of the Sahara, the movement was founded by **Abdallah ibn Yasin**, who established a strict Maliki Islamic discipline in a *ribat*. Under the military leadership of **Yusuf ibn Tashfin**, the Almoravids captured Sijilmasa in 1053 and founded **Marrakesh** as their capital in 1062\. They then extended their rule across Morocco and into al-Andalus. In 1086, Yusuf ibn Tashfin decisively defeated Christian forces at the **Battle of Zallaqah (Sagrajas)**, halting the *Reconquista*. By 1090, he annexed al-Andalus, creating an empire that stretched from the Senegal River to most of modern Spain and Portugal. Almoravid rule, characterized by an austere and militant Maliki doctrine, also introduced taxes allowed by the Quran, which benefited the population and improved the economy. However, the empire decayed due to weakness at its center and external pressures, with Christian kingdoms advancing again.

The **Almohad dynasty** (1121–1269), another Berber movement, rose to replace the Almoravids. Founded by **Ibn Tumart**, a Masmuda Berber scholar who declared himself the Mahdi and preached a radical doctrine of divine unity (*Tawhid*). His successor, **Abd al-Mu'min**, created an empire that conquered Marrakesh in 1147, ending Almoravid rule, and expanded across the entire Maghrib to Tripoli by 1159, and into al-Andalus by 1172\. The Almohad Caliphate was the largest empire ever ruled from Morocco. This era fostered an intellectual awakening, attracting philosophers like **Ibn Rushd (Averroes)** and **Ibn Tufayl**, whose works influenced the European Renaissance. However, the Almohads were less tolerant of Jews, persecuting communities and destroying synagogues. Almohad power began to decline after **Muhammad al-Nasir** suffered a crushing defeat at the **Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa** in 1212 against Christian forces, which marked "the beginning of the end" for Muslim Spain. The empire fragmented, with peripheral dynasties like the Hafsids and Zayyanids breaking away, and the Marinids taking Fez in 1245\. The last Almohad caliph was killed in Marrakesh in 1269 by the Marinids.

The **Marinid dynasty** (1244–1465), a Zenata Berber tribe, then rose to power, capturing Fez in 1245 and Marrakesh in 1269\. The Marinid era in their capital, Fez, was a golden age of art, architecture, and intellectual life, marked by the establishment of the *madrasa* system, such as the Bou Inania and Al-Attarine madrasas. They used Arab and Christian mercenaries and, on occasion, appointed Jews to administrative positions. Despite their cultural achievements, the Marinid state was often unstable and plagued by internal feuds and external pressures, particularly from Portuguese incursions on the coast, such as the capture of Ceuta in 1415\. The Sharifian movement, emphasizing descent from the Prophet, grew in strength as Marinid legitimacy waned, culminating in a revolt in Fez in 1465 that overthrew the last Marinid sultan, Abd al-Haqq II.

The **Wattasid dynasty** (1472–1554), a collateral branch of the Marinids, formally took power after a prolonged struggle. Their rule, however, was marked by internal weakness and an inability to resist Portuguese expansion along the coast. Wattasid sultans like Muhammad "al-Burtughali" led campaigns against the Portuguese but struggled with the financial burden of perpetual warfare, which undermined their legitimacy. This period was also marked by the arrival of **Andalusian refugees** from Spain after the fall of Granada in 1492, who settled on the Moroccan coast and contributed to both commerce and corsairing activities. In the south, the alliance between sharifism and Sufi brotherhoods, particularly the Jazuliyya, gained significant influence, laying the groundwork for a new dynasty focused on *jihad* against the Portuguese.

The **Saadian dynasty** (1510–1659), a Sharifian family from the Sous valley, emerged as the leading force in Morocco. They gained legitimacy by spearheading a *jihad* against the Portuguese, capturing Agadir in 1541\. By 1549, **Muhammad al-Shaykh** conquered Fez, effectively ending Wattasid rule and unifying much of Morocco. Muhammad al-Shaykh refused Ottoman suzerainty, asserting Moroccan independence, and modeled his army on the Ottomans, equipping it with modern firearms. He was assassinated in 1557 by an Ottoman agent. His successor, **Mawlay Abdallah al-Ghalib** (1557–1574), ruthlessly consolidated power, built a professional army, and laid the basis for economic growth, including a Jewish quarter (mellah) in Marrakesh and rebuilding the Ben Youssef madrasa.

The **Battle of the Three Kings** (Oued el-Mekhazine or Alcácer Quibir) in 1578 was a pivotal moment. The deposed Saadian sultan Muhammad al-Mutawakkil sought aid from **King Sebastian I of Portugal**, who invaded Morocco with a large army. They were decisively defeated by the Saadian army led by **Abd al-Malik** and his brother **Ahmad al-Mansur** near Ksar el-Kebir. All three kings died in the battle. This victory secured Morocco's independence from European territorial conquest and filled the treasury with ransoms and booty, ushering in the "Golden Age" of **Ahmad al-Mansur** (1578–1603). Al-Mansur used this wealth and diplomatic acumen to expand trade, develop a massive sugar industry in the Sous and Tensift valleys using black slave labor, import arms from England, and launch the 1591 invasion of the Songhai Empire, giving Morocco control over trans-Saharan gold and salt mines.

After al-Mansur's death from the plague in 1603, Morocco plunged into a devastating and prolonged **civil war (1603-1627)** among his sons, a period known as the "Three Miseries of Barbary" (Plague, Famine, Civil War). This led to the disintegration of central authority, economic collapse, diversion of trans-Saharan trade, and the occupation of coastal towns by Europeans, including the Spanish seizure of Larache in 1610\. Regional powers emerged, such as the maraboutic chieftaincy in Iligh and the powerful **Zawiya of Dila** in the Middle Atlas, which eventually gained significant political and military control, even occupying Fez in 1641\. This era also saw the rise of **corsairing** from Salé and Rabat, initially by Andalusian refugees, who became a formidable naval force, raiding shipping across the Atlantic and even reaching Iceland. The decline of central power allowed this corsairing to flourish, with "renegades" (European converts) often serving as captains.

The **Alaouite dynasty** (1631–Present), another Sharifian family from Tafilalt, rose to prominence amidst this chaos. **Mawlay al-Sharif** was declared leader in 1631, and his son **Mawlay al-Rashid** (1664–1672) eventually reunited the country, capturing Fez in 1666, Dila in 1668, and Marrakesh in 1669\. The Alaouite state was consolidated under **Mawlay Ismail** (1672–1727), who crushed revolts, established a professional army of black soldiers (*Abid al-Bukhari*), and moved the capital to **Meknès**, transforming it with massive construction projects. Ismail's reign involved corsairing and complex diplomacy with European powers, using captives as bargaining chips and actively retaking Atlantic outposts from the Spanish and Portuguese. He cultivated the sharifian cult and some Sufi orders but centralized power, reducing the autonomy of marabouts and zawiyas.

After Ismail's death in 1727, Morocco again faced a period of **civil war and instability** over succession. Stability was gradually restored under **Sidi Mohammed III** (1757–1790), who rebuilt the state on commerce rather than force. He closed many ports to foreign trade but gave a monopoly to the new port of Essaouira (Mogador), built by European captives under European supervision, which became a thriving center for European merchants and Jewish traders. Sidi Mohammed III also signed a treaty with the **United States of America** in 1786, making Morocco the first state to recognize US independence. He reasserted central authority through religious function, courting the *ulama* and, when necessary, suppressing defiant *tariqas*.

His successor, **Mawlay Sulayman** (1792–1822), struggled with rural revolts, opposition from the *ulama* and *sharifs* over taxation and economic policy, leading to riots in Fez. By the 19th century, **European influence** intensified. The **French invasion of Algeria in 1830** confirmed Moroccan fears of Christian invasion and broke Morocco's link with the Arabic East. **Mawlay Abderrahman** (1822-1859) faced a weak army incapable of fighting the French. Moroccan efforts to reform the army along European lines were largely ineffective and expensive. The **Spanish-Moroccan War of 1859-1860** further weakened Morocco, leading to territorial concessions and a large indemnity. European financial penetration increased, with foreign currency flooding the market and European products becoming dominant. The **protégé system**, which exempted European-protected Moroccans (many of whom were Jews) from Moroccan laws and taxes, grew dramatically, undermining Moroccan sovereignty.

The late 19th century saw a decline in the sultan's authority, marked by rural rebellions and the rise of powerful regional strongmen known as the "**Big Caids**" (El Glaoui, El Goundafi, Mtouggi), who controlled passes in the Atlas Mountains. **Ba Ahmad**, the effective ruler from 1894 to 1900, relied on these Caids and religious leaders like Ma al-Aynan to control the south, using theatrical violence to maintain order. **Mawlay Abdul Aziz** (1894–1908) attempted administrative and financial reforms (the *tartib* tax), but faced opposition from the *ulama* and foreign consulates, leading to national bankruptcy and reliance on European loans. Secret European negotiations, including the **Entente Cordiale of 1904**, formalized French preponderance over Morocco in exchange for other colonial "rights". The sultan's authority collapsed further with rebellions like that of "Abu Himara" (Jilali bin Idris) and widespread unrest. French bombardments and occupation of Casablanca and Oujda further encroached on Moroccan sovereignty. **Mawlay Abdelhafid** (1908–1912) rose to power with support from *ulama* and artisans who demanded the restoration of Morocco's independence and the rejection of European concessions, though he proved unable to fulfill these. He brutally suppressed opponents like al-Kittani and Abu Himara, but rural opposition and foreign military advances continued. This period saw the spread of **Salafiyya** ideas, calling for a return to genuine Islam and strict *shari'a*, and the tiny beginnings of a constitutionalist movement.

The **French and Spanish Protectorate** was established by the **Treaty of Fez on March 30, 1912**, ending Moroccan sovereignty and dividing the country into French and Spanish zones, with Tangier as an international zone. **Hubert Lyautey** became the first French Resident General (1912–1925), implementing "indirect rule" that maintained outward forms of the precolonial system (sultan, flag) but preserved a division between Arab and Berber speakers, viewing Berbers as potential allies. France embarked on a "conquest of Morocco," facing fierce resistance from numerous tribes and local *jihads*. Economically, the Protectorate focused on capital-intensive agriculture for exports, dam-building, railways, ports, and the nationalization of phosphates, which benefited French companies and *colons*.

The **Rif War (1921–1926)** was a major anti-colonial conflict in the Spanish zone, led by **Muhammad bin Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi**. Abd al-Karim, an educated *qadi* and Salafi adherent, built a modern army and inflicted the "worst defeat of a colonial army in Africa in the twentieth century" at Anual in 1921\. He aimed to establish a "country with a government and a flag," referring to a "République Rifaine," and imposed strict *shari'a* law, centralized power, and developed infrastructure. Despite initial successes, the Rifis were eventually defeated by a combined French and Spanish force, and Abd al-Karim surrendered in 1926, going into exile.

**Nationalist sentiment** grew in the French zone, initially through "Free Schools" that provided modern Islamic education in Arabic. The **Berber Dahir of 1930**, which codified customary law in Berber areas separate from *shari'a*, ignited widespread nationalist protest in urban mosques, uniting Moroccans against colonial policies. Nationalist groups, like the **Kutlat al-Amal al-Wattani** (National Action Block), emerged from this, evolving into political parties like the **Istiqlal Party**. During **World War II**, Sultan **Muhammad V** (1927–1961) supported the French but later backed the nationalist movement, becoming a symbol of the struggle for independence. His 1947 speech in Tangier, appealing for independence and territorial unity, further galvanized the movement.

Morocco gained **independence** in early 1956, after Sultan Mohammed V returned from exile and negotiated with France. Spain also relinquished its protectorate, and Tangier was reintegrated. However, independence began in a fragmented fashion, with significant practical problems stemming from the colonial legacy, including widespread illiteracy and uneven land distribution. The new nation immediately faced a **conflict over power** between the monarchy and nationalist parties, with the king swiftly consolidating control over the newly formed army and police, often staffed by former colonial officers. The Rif experienced a violent rebellion in 1958, crushed by **Crown Prince Hassan**.

**King Hassan II** (1961–1999) designed a new system to maintain royal power, relying on rural *qaids*, army control, and his religious role as Commander of the Faithful. He promulgated a new constitution in 1962, establishing a multi-party parliamentary system designed to fragment opposition. Morocco experienced an **economic crisis**, with a focus on capital-intensive agriculture for exports (dams, fruit, wine), leading to a stagnation of the home market and dependence on external markets. Repression, notably orchestrated by **Mohammed Oufkir**, was used to quell protests, and the political system faced declining legitimacy.

The **Western Sahara conflict** became the pre-eminent nationalist issue from the 1970s. After Spain withdrew in 1975, Morocco claimed the territory. The **Polisario Front** emerged, demanding self-determination and engaging in guerrilla warfare. King Hassan II responded with the **Green March** in 1975, mobilizing half a million Moroccans to symbolically claim the territory, leading to its division between Morocco and Mauritania, and later Morocco's annexation of the entire region. The conflict continued with the Polisario supported by Algeria and Libya. King Hassan II fought against the rise of **Islamism** by emphasizing his own Islamic credentials and repressing fragmented Islamist groups. Social changes included increased literacy and the rise of a Berber cultural revival, particularly among migrants in Europe. In the 1990s, Hassan II initiated political and economic reforms, including a new constitution and privatization, bringing opposition parties into a coalition government.

Upon King Hassan II's death in 1999, **King Mohammed VI** (1999–present) ascended the throne, promising continuity but also reforms. He immediately tackled human rights, releasing political prisoners, allowing exiles to return, and sacking the powerful Minister of the Interior, Driss Basri. Despite a commitment to openness, limits on freedom of the press and continued arrests of Islamists were observed. The **Western Sahara negotiations** continued, with Morocco advocating for autonomy under its sovereignty and Polisario for a referendum. Mohammed VI's reign saw a new openness in royal traditions, exemplified by his public marriage to a commoner. Elections showed the continued importance of Berber identity and moderate Islamist parties. Modern Morocco, despite being one of the most open societies in the Middle East, maintains a strong royal power, with the king claiming religious legitimacy as Commander of the Faithful and actively ruling.

Morocco's political system in 2021 and 2022 saw the monarchy consolidate its central role, a decade after the February 20, 2011, uprisings. The 2021 legislative elections, utilizing an amended electoral system that abolished the 3% threshold, resulted in the National Rally of Independents (RNI) becoming the largest party, followed by the Party of Authenticity and Modernity (PAM) and the Istiqlal Party (PI). These three pro-palace parties formed a coalition, indicating a reinstatement of technocrats in parliament, while the Islamist Party of Justice and Development (PJD) lost 90% of its seats after holding power for a decade. This shift, coupled with a weakened opposition, has narrowed the political landscape, reinforcing the palace's authority where the king rules and governs, and his directives guide economic and social policies. The current government has committed to implementing the king's 2020 New Development Model, with the monarchy driving top-down reforms that further marginalize elected officials.

The period also witnessed a **diminished space for criticism and opposition**, with authorities employing strategies of suppression, including unfair trials, harassment, and smear campaigns via state-aligned media. Relatives of dissidents are targeted, and fabricated charges such as libel, rape, money laundering, and espionage are used. The secret services (DGED) have seen a dramatic increase in their role and were accused in December 2022 of significant involvement in a European Parliament corruption scandal through lobbying and corrupting members.

On the social front, economic progress has primarily benefited a wealthy minority. The working and middle classes have faced significant burdens due to the COVID-19 crisis, high inflation, and stagnant annual GDP per capita, leading to increasing poverty, vulnerability, and widening disparities. Many still lack access to essential health care, transportation, and adequate housing. Ongoing protests express concerns about skyrocketing prices of goods, denounce repression, and highlight collusion between business and politics. The government has faced protests and critical social media campaigns since its inception, indicating a perceived lack of credibility and legitimacy, with citizens often circumventing political parties they see as co-opted.

Morocco has also adopted a more aggressive and confrontational foreign policy. Tensions arose with Spain and Germany over their positions on Western Sahara; Morocco suspended diplomatic relations with Germany in 2021 due to Berlin's disapproval of the U.S. recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the territory. Similarly, diplomatic strains with Madrid followed the secret hospitalization of Polisario Front leader Brahim Ghali in Spain. Diplomatic relations were later resumed after both Germany and Spain endorsed Morocco's autonomy plan for Western Sahara. Additionally, Morocco has strengthened cooperation with Western African and Sahel countries, and is pursuing new partnerships with China, India, Brazil, Israel, and Russia.

Historically, after the French protectorate (established in 1912\) significantly impacted traditional economic sectors and pushed many into poverty, **King Mohammed V declared Morocco's independence on March 2, 1956**, supported by a nationalist movement and widespread unrest. Mohammed V encouraged the formation of political parties to prevent power concentration and maintained firm governmental control until his death in 1961\. His successor, **King Hassan II**, continued to wield absolute power, crafting constitutions that subordinated judicial, legislative, and executive institutions to the monarchy. This era, known as the "Years of Lead," was marked by relentless state oppression against opposition and dissident voices, with protests by students, workers, and the unemployed violently crushed. Hassan II successfully forged national unity by orchestrating the **"Green March" on November 6, 1975**, where thousands of unarmed civilians crossed into the "Spanish Sahara". Spain subsequently relinquished its claim, but Morocco's assertion led to a conflict with the **Polisario Front (PF)**, formed in 1973 to establish an independent state. A 16-year insurgency ended with a 1991 United Nations-brokered truce, promising a referendum on independence for the Sahrawi people.

The end of the Cold War brought international pressure for political reforms, prompting Hassan II to implement measures expanding freedoms of expression, assembly, association, and the press. Political prisoners were released, and the unicameral legislature was replaced with a bicameral one. In 1998, an opposition party formed the "Government of Change," which enacted further reforms. Hassan II also initiated economic reforms under the supervision of the IMF and World Bank, known as Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs), which involved trade liberalization, public spending cuts, privatization, and financial deregulation. However, SAPs exacerbated unemployment and inequalities, and the government failed to adequately address poverty and stagnant living standards.

Upon Hassan II's death in 1999, his son **Mohammed VI** continued a path of political opening. Significant reforms followed the 2011 "Arab uprisings," during which the February 20 Youth Movement organized street protests. On March 9, 2011, Mohammed VI promised constitutional reforms to extend parliamentary powers and grant judicial independence. Despite these promises, the reform process faltered, with socioeconomic inequalities persisting and triggering new "Hirak" protests in the Rif region in October 2016\. These protests continue as the power structure remains unchanged and corruption is ongoing.

Regarding stateness, Morocco maintains a monopoly on the use of force throughout its internationally recognized territory, **except for Western Sahara**, where tensions continue to rise. Morocco claims Western Sahara based on historical, cultural, and religious ties, while the Polisario Front, formed in 1973, seeks an independent state. In 1976, the PF established the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), which is recognized by many governments and is a full member of the African Union. The conflict in Western Sahara escalated in 2021 and 2022, worsening relations between Morocco and Algeria, which supports the PF. Morocco insists on its autonomy plan, supported by the United States and France. **Ceuta and Melilla** remain under Spanish control, a claim Morocco disputes, while Spain considers their Spanishness "non-negotiable". Morocco is considered the safest country in the Maghreb according to the Global Terrorism Index 2022, but it still faces sporadic threats from small, independent terrorist cells affiliated with the Islamic State (IS) group. Moroccan authorities reported a 23% decrease in terror-related arrests in 2021 and 2022 compared to 2019, but continue to conduct counter-terrorism raids.

Morocco's status as a nation-state is largely considered legitimate by most actors. Amazigh groups advocate for the inclusion of their culture but do not challenge the nation-state's legitimacy. However, many Sahrawis, like the PF, reject Moroccan nationality and demand self-determination. **Justice and Kindness (Al-Adl wal-Ihsane)**, an influential Islamist association, opposes the hereditary and religious legitimacy of the monarchy, aspiring to create an Islamic state, and its members report systematic police harassment. Left-wing forces, such as the Democratic Path, boycott elections, deeming them unfair. The Democratic Left Federation seeks to establish a parliamentary monarchy where the king "reigns but not governs".

**Islam is the official religion of the state**. The constitution guarantees freedoms of thought, opinion, expression, and belief, but only recognizes Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Sunni Muslims constitute over 99% of the population, and non-Islamic or incompatible Islamic materials are prohibited. The monarchy regulates religious institutions and discourse, with the king serving as the "commander of the faithful" and protector of "Moroccan Islam," a key element of his political authority. The Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs (MEIA) oversees religious education, Sufi orders, Friday sermons, and media programs. Political parties are constitutionally prohibited from being founded on religious, linguistic, ethnic, or regional bases, or from infringing upon the Muslim religion. Morocco's legal system combines secular principles from the French civil code with Sharia law for personal status issues like marriage and inheritance.

Morocco's administrative infrastructure extends nationwide, yet significant disparities in access to basic services persist due to excessive centralization and hierarchization. Despite decentralization efforts, the Ministry of Interior's control and overlapping competences make administrative procedures complex. Local authorities, dependent on state funding, lack fiscal autonomy and full participation in territorial development. While the constitution mandates equal access to services, and 100% electricity access was achieved by 2020 (partly through solar home systems in remote areas), only 90.4% of the population has access to basic water services, with rural areas facing higher inequality, overcharging, and untreated water. Access to clean water and sanitation in shantytowns is particularly low. A severe drought in March 2022 led to water conservation measures and a significant investment program of MAD 70 billion (€6.5 billion) by ONEE for drinking water supply and wastewater reuse by 2035\. Education, health care, and transportation remain the most deficient public services, with only 20% of preschools in rural areas and limited health care outside large cities. In Western Sahara, infrastructure projects have primarily benefited Laayoune province, leaving other areas with socioeconomic difficulties.

National and local elections are held regularly, but they primarily serve to maintain a "democratic façade" rather than foster significant popular political participation or autonomous democratic institutions. The **2021 parliamentary elections** saw the RNI, PAM, and PI form a coalition government led by Aziz Akhannouch, a wealthy businessman close to the king, while the PJD suffered a major defeat. Concerns about the transparency of these elections arose, with reports of "dirty money" and the Interior Ministry influencing voters, especially in rural areas where trust in local elites is high. High numbers of spoiled ballots were interpreted as protest votes. The turnout was 50.18%, higher in rural and desert areas compared to urban areas. New electoral laws, like Organic Law 04-21, which calculates parliamentary seats based on registered voters rather than valid votes and abolished the 3% threshold, have led to greater parliamentary fragmentation. Al-Adl wal-Ihsane and the Democratic Way boycotted these elections, calling them unfair.

Morocco's political system is an executive monarchy where the **king reigns and governs**, reserving domains such as religion, security, and strategic policy. The king heads the Ministerial Council, can dissolve parliament, wields veto power, and issues royal decrees immune to judicial control. He nominates pro-palace technocrats and appoints judges, effectively controlling the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The Makhzen (economic, political, and military elite surrounding the monarchy) acts as a "shadow government," influencing opaque decision-making. The current parliament, composed of pro-palace technocrats, facilitates legislation aligned with royal interests, leaving street protests as the main form of opposition due to the government's limited popular legitimacy.

Constitutional guarantees for freedoms of reunion, assembly, peaceful demonstration, association, and syndical membership exist. However, many of Morocco's 30,000 to 50,000 civil society organizations (CSOs), especially human rights groups, face practical impediments like surveillance, travel restrictions, legal harassment, and denied registration. The Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) reported numerous local branches unable to operate due to denied administrative formalities. Law 76 on public assemblies regulates these gatherings, requiring prior notification and allowing spontaneous assemblies to be disrupted in the name of public order, with authorities sometimes using excessive force.

Freedom of expression, including for the press, is constitutionally guaranteed, but criticism of **Islam, the monarchy, state institutions, or the country’s territorial integrity (Western Sahara) is punishable by law**. Critical journalists face harassment, and despite the press code abolishing prison sentences, sections of the penal code related to national security are used to imprison them (e.g., Omar Radi and Soulaimane Raissouni on charges like espionage and sexual assault). These prosecutions serve as intimidation, leading to self-censorship and reduced quality of reporting. State-affiliated media and social media are used to spread rumors and false information to discredit journalists and activists. Authorities employ sophisticated surveillance tools, including **Pegasus spyware**, to limit free speech and silence critical voices online. The Right to Information Law (31.13) was ratified in 2018, but a continued crackdown on journalists indicates a lack of full commitment to transparency.

The judicial system is not independent of the monarchy. The king presides over the Supreme Council of the Judicial Power, which largely controls judicial matters, including the appointment of judges. The selection process for judges lacks transparency and merit, with the executive able to influence nominations and promotions. Courts are frequently used to punish political opponents, activists, and critics. While the law provides for fair trials, this is not always upheld. Pretrial detainees can be held beyond legal limits, and arbitrary arrest and detention are common. Reports indicate the use of coercion to obtain confessions, and prisons are overcrowded, lack basic facilities, and fail to treat minors fairly. The law prohibits criticism of Islam and proselytizing Muslims, leading to arrests for online insults or publicly eating during Ramadan. Women, Amazigh groups, Black Moroccans, and LGBTQ+ individuals face legal and societal discrimination.

The stability of democratic institutions is hampered by the king's retention of all economic and political powers, including government formation and intervention rights. The Makhzen (advisers and elite around the king) holds significant political power through clientelist networks, and royal commissions often outweigh ministries. While Morocco's discourse emphasizes promoting freedoms and strengthening institutions, concrete progress remains limited, with the monarchy having constrained the role of political actors since 2016\. The "police state is making a comeback," with the Makhzen using force in demonstrations and secret services restricting the press and civil society.

Morocco's monarchy has used liberalization to control opposition rather than introduce genuine democratic reforms, resulting in a fragmented multi-party system. Over 30 political parties compete, but the regime creates "administration parties" to contain opposition, and the new 2021 election law (abolishing the 3% threshold) further fragmented parliament. Governments often consist of large coalitions, and opposition parties, including the PJD and leftist parties, have been largely co-opted, losing credibility and unable to pressure the government. This leads to significant cynicism toward electoral politics, as most parties are perceived as "Makhzanized" and acquiescent to the palace. Workers can form unions, but collective bargaining is often absent, and local authorities have refused to register new unions or dispersed teachers' demonstrations. Despite significant popular support for groups like Al-Adl wal-Ihsane, the February 20 Movement, and Hirak Rif, these movements face severe repression. Trust in the government and parliament is relatively low, while trust in the police and royal army is higher. Support for democracy is declining, as it is often perceived through economic performance and stability rather than free and fair elections. Social trust is primarily concentrated within the family, and membership in voluntary associations is low.

Economically, Morocco ranked 123rd in the 2021 Human Development Index (HDI), falling into the "medium" category due to disparities in health care access and income. Significant gender inequalities persist in employment and education, exacerbated by the pandemic. Morocco has one of the highest income inequality rates in North Africa (Gini coefficient 39.5 in 2013), with poverty widespread and increasing. The pandemic and inflation lowered living standards by 7.2% between 2019 and 2022, affecting millions, with 470,000 Moroccans living below $1.90 per day. Endemic corruption limits access to public services for the poor, and a weak labor market has worsened living conditions.

While reforms have been made to improve market competitiveness, their impact has been insufficient, leading to low productivity, limited export diversification, and weak firm entry/growth. The economy's orientation towards agroindustry for exports makes it dependent on cereal imports. Morocco is on the FATF "gray list" due to concerns over money laundering and terrorism financing, and barriers to business include a lack of transparency in government procurement, bureaucracy, high corruption, and the economic hegemony of the Makhzen. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) play a dominant role in many sectors, benefiting from monopolies and exemptions. The Moroccan Competition Council (MCC) has called for an end to monopolies in key sectors like fuel, banking, and insurance. The informal economy is estimated at 36.6% of GDP, leaving workers vulnerable and facilitating tax evasion. The MCC, while active in investigating anti-competitive practices and mergers, is constrained by palace politics, as seen when its head was dismissed after reporting on predatory practices by a company owned by the head of government. Some sectors, like phosphate extraction (controlled by the OCP Group), remain closed to foreign investment, and foreigners cannot own agricultural land.

Inflation has intensified, reaching 8.3% in 2022, primarily driven by food and transportation prices. The central bank raised its key interest rate to address this, aiming for price stability. Morocco's economy is recovering from external shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. The plan to liberalize the Moroccan dirham has faltered, with the country refusing the second phase in 2022 due to economic vulnerabilities. Macroeconomic statistics show negative trends, including a widening current account deficit (to \-$3.3 billion in 2021\) and an increasing trade deficit, though offset by tourism and remittances. Public debt stood at 68.9% of GDP in 2021\.

Property rights are constitutionally guaranteed, with increased homeownership. However, over one-third of land is collectively owned by tribes and managed by the Interior Ministry, which can dispose of it without tribal consent. Liberalization efforts have led to the sale of tribal lands to real estate corporations, resulting in evictions without fair compensation. While women were historically excluded from inheriting tribal land, recent legal changes allow it, though the interpretation of residence criteria for land rights has faced criticism for excluding women. Small and micro firms dominate the economy, but face a poor business climate, limited finance, high labor taxes, and cumbersome procedures, with private enterprise hampered by crony capitalism and a rentier economy.

Morocco's social protection system covers public and private sector employees, with compulsory health insurance expanding to over 23 million individuals by early 2023\. Public expenditure on health reached 2.1% of GDP in 2019, but the sector suffers from a lack of practitioners, mismanagement, and urban-rural disparities. Income inequality remains high, with the wealthiest 20% of Moroccans holding ten times the income of the least affluent 20%. Women continue to face legal and societal discrimination, with lower literacy rates, a significant wage gap, and limited access to administrative and economic decision-making positions. Child labor is prevalent, and migrants face discrimination in wages, working conditions, and housing.

Morocco's GDP reached $132.7 billion in 2021, with growth driven by agricultural and non-agricultural activities. Foreign direct investment increased by over 50% in 2021\. However, economic growth slowed to 1.6% in Q3 2022 due to rising commodity prices and delayed rainfalls. Unemployment remained stable at 11.5% in 2021\.

The country has implemented various laws and policies for sustainable development and environmental protection, including the Green Morocco Plan and the National Climate Plan: Horizon 2030, and ratified international agreements like the Paris Agreement. However, Morocco is highly vulnerable to climate change, with its economy reliant on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, fisheries, and tourism. Problems such as water scarcity, food insecurity, desertification, and shoreline erosion have intensified, partly due to the conversion of cereal cultivation to water-intensive arboriculture. The energy sector heavily relies on imported hydrocarbons despite a vast renewable energy project.

Education policy saw 6.8% of GDP dedicated to it in 2020, with a literacy rate of 73.8% in 2018\. Public satisfaction with education is declining, leading many parents to private schools, which widens social disparities. High dropout rates, limited rural schools, a mismatch between skills taught and labor market demand, overcrowded classrooms, and underpaid teachers are major issues. The Arabization of the education system and the shift to Arabic for science and math have contributed to a decline in instruction quality and increased repetition rates. Learning poverty has increased, with an estimated 70% of 10-year-olds unable to understand a simple written text.

Morocco faces significant structural constraints, including the **Western Sahara conflict** and vulnerability to the climate crisis, both demanding substantial financial investment that detracts from other developmental areas. The conflict alone is estimated to consume 3% of GDP annually. Declining rainfall severely impacts the agricultural sector, increasing dependence on staple crop imports and exacerbating socioeconomic imbalances. An increasing number of Moroccans are considering emigration due to economic hardship, lack of opportunities, and marginalization. While the number of registered CSOs has grown, most face resource shortages and co-optation by the regime, limiting their role in democratic processes. The **Western Sahara conflict** continues to be a major source of tension, with intensified fighting since October 2020 ending a 29-year cease-fire. This conflict also fuels regional tensions, leading to diplomatic ruptures with Algeria and Spain. Despite being one of the safest countries globally regarding terrorism, jihadi groups remain a serious threat, with authorities continually dismantling IS-linked cells. Tensions also exist between Moroccans and sub-Saharan migrants.

The monarchy's priorities, particularly the "new development model," focus on economic and social development but avoid addressing issues of crony capitalism or political system reforms. The current government faces accusations of conflicts of interest and struggles to fulfill promises of welfare support and job creation. Most reforms implemented are essentially renewals of old initiatives. While Morocco consults with international experts and receives significant funding from the EU, recommendations that conflict with regime interests are often dismissed. Elections in 2021 were marred by vote-buying and manipulation, and the monarchy remains central, isolating representative institutions from decision-making.

The Supreme Audit Institution reports increasing state debt (68.9% of GDP in 2021\) and public institutions struggling to control spending. Mining, particularly phosphates controlled by the state-owned OCP Group (95% government-owned), accounts for a significant portion of GDP and export revenues, but how these revenues are invested remains unclear, and the parliament cannot control OCP's functioning. The fishing sector, largely from Western Sahara, is a rentier economy benefiting powerful families through fishing licenses. Overall, the palace's control paralyzes state institutions and hinders policy coordination, with political parties often acting as lobbies for personal interests rather than drivers of reform. Corruption is endemic, permeates society, and is exacerbated by ineffective law enforcement and political pressure that prevents anti-corruption legislation. Information about corruption within the government is often concealed.

Morocco operates as a hardline autocracy where the monarchy holds both political and religious prerogatives, and there is a general consensus within the political elite that democratic reforms are not a priority. The overwhelming victory of pro-palace parties in 2021 signals a lack of political will for broad reforms. There is a broad consensus among the monarchy and major parties in favor of a market economy, but this often leads to crony capitalism and the concentration of wealth, with the king and head of government being among the wealthiest individuals. Reform actors have been co-opted or sidelined, leaving an "empty shell" opposition. Collusion between business and politics, coupled with socioeconomic challenges, fuels popular resentment and protests. The Hirak movement in the Rif, for example, crumbled under violent repression. The 2011 constitution introduced the right to petition, but complex legal conditions and state control over CSOs limit their effectiveness and their ability to challenge political power. The Moroccan Equity and Reconciliation Commission (2004) documented past human rights abuses but lacked the power to hold perpetrators accountable.

Morocco frequently seeks assistance from international donors, receiving significant funding from the EU and US for various development initiatives. However, relations with the EU have deteriorated due to the European Parliament's criticism of Morocco's human rights record and accusations of bribery in the "Qatargate" scandal. Morocco has diversified its international partners to include China, India, Brazil, Israel, and Russia, aiming to reduce dependence on Europe and assert its influence in Africa, particularly in counter-terrorism efforts. The 2020 Moroccan-Israeli normalization deal has fostered stronger economic, security, and military cooperation, including arms sales. Ultimately, the Moroccan regime remains reluctant to implement genuine political reforms, leading to high societal expectations and potential social unrest. Achieving stability requires substantive structural reforms to enhance accountability and transparency, strengthen political parties, and reinforce the independence of parliament. Economic transformation requires addressing inflation, improving public spending, reforming state-owned enterprises, promoting the private sector, and combating crony capitalism and monopolies to tackle inequalities and reduce poverty.

The Portuguese fortress of Mazagão (modern El Jadida), active from 1502 to 1769, housed a complex military organization reflecting both medieval and Renaissance warfare. At its head was the **Captain-Governor**, appointed by the Portuguese Crown, who held supreme military and civil authority. Examples include Louis de Loureiro, governor from 1541 to 1548, a veteran administrator. Beneath him were **Officers and Nobility (*Fidalgos*)**, who were *fronteiros* (frontier noblemen) serving temporary duties with their private soldiers. Their motivations centered on chivalric valor, honor, and royal favor, often clashing with disciplined tactics but ensuring the highest quality arms and armor. **Specialists** were also crucial, including engineer-architects for design and expansion, bombardiers, artillerymen, a constable, clerks, and medical staff (physician, barber-surgeon, apothecary).

The bulk of the garrison comprised several types of **Professional Soldiers (*Soldados*)**, forming a combined-arms force. Infantry was organized into *terços*, flexible tactical units similar to the Spanish *tercio*, though smaller in North Africa. These units included **Pikemen**, forming a defensive core against cavalry, and **Arquebusiers and Musketeers**, providing firepower with matchlock arquebuses (standard in the early-to-mid 16th century, later supplemented by muskets). **Crossbowmen (*Besteiros*)** were vital in the early 16th century for missile support and deterring counter-attacks, but were largely phased out by the 1550s in favor of arquebusiers. **Cavalry** was indispensable for warfare outside the walls. **Heavy Armored Cavalry (*Acorbetados*)** likely consisted of *fidalgos* with plate armor, but adapted to lighter equipment for Moroccan terrain. **Light Cavalry (*Ginetes*)** were more common and effective, wearing lighter armor and riding agile horses for fast-paced raids and skirmishes. **Auxiliary and Local Forces** were also critical, with the Portuguese employing salaried Muslim cavalry known as **Makhzaniyyah** to police the countryside, collect taxes, and ensure tribal obedience. This diverse force created a dynamic, pragmatic, and sometimes fractious military environment.

The equipment of a Portuguese soldier at Mazagão evolved significantly over time.

**In the early-to-mid 16th Century (c. 1514-1600)**, the soldier was a transitional figure, blending late-medieval and Renaissance styles.

* **Helmets:** Open-faced helmets were standard. The **morion** (almond-shaped, high central comb, curved brim) and **cabasset** (simpler, without prominent comb) were iconic and common for infantry. The **burgonet** (skull with small comb, brim, hinged cheek-pieces) was also popular. Earlier forms like the **sallet** and **war hat** remained in use during the initial decades, favored by crossbowmen, handgunners, and light cavalry.  
* **Torso and Limb Armor:** Full plate armor was reserved for wealthy officers or *fidalgos*. The standard for infantry was a **steel corselet** (breastplate and backplate, often with tassets for upper thighs). **Brigandine** (canvas/leather vest lined with overlapping small steel plates) was a common, flexible, and comfortable alternative. Mail shirts were also worn, often under other armor, but were avoided in hot, humid climates due to heat retention and rust. Limb protection was often minimal for common soldiers, with perhaps shoulder-plates (spaulders) and armlets (vambraces), but rarely gauntlets or leg armor. The garrison's appearance was heterogeneous, reflecting pragmatic use of equipment until it fell apart or was locally repaired.  
* **Melee Weapons:** The **Espada Preta de Bordo** (Carracks Black Sword) was distinctive, featuring a "crab" guard and often painted black for camouflage and rust prevention. It was used in African outposts and sometimes given to local chiefs. The **Montante** was a large, slender two-handed sword for specialists, used to control space and break formations. The **Terçado** was a short, broad cutting sword adapted for close-quarters combat in North Africa. **Pikes and spears** were primary for rank-and-file infantry in formations. **Daggers** were universal sidearms.  
* **Ranged Weapons:** The **arquebus** was definitive, a matchlock weapon effective against armor despite slow reloading, and was spread by the Portuguese throughout Asia and Africa. **Crossbows** remained significant until the 1550s, valued for silent operation and power. **Artillery** (cannons of various sizes) was crucial for fortress defense and field expeditions.  
* **Visual Depictions:** The *Pastrana Tapestries* (c. 1475\) show late 15th-century military equipment relevant to Mazagão's early years. The *Códice Casanatense* (c. 1540\) provides a look at high-status Portuguese soldiers in a colonial setting. Benin Bronzes (16th-17th C.) offer external depictions of Portuguese costume, including morions, swords, and early firearms.

**By the 17th and 18th Centuries (c. 1601-1769)**, there was a profound shift from armored knights to uniformed infantry.

* **Decline of Armor:** Due to the increasing power of firearms, plate armor became largely obsolete for infantry and rare for cavalry. Cavalry typically retained only a cuirass (breast-and-backplate), with helmets often replaced by felt hats that might conceal a steel skullcap (*secrete*). The **buff coat** (thick oiled leather jacket) emerged in the 17th century, providing effective protection against sword cuts.  
* **Rise of the Uniform:** Standardized military uniforms developed for battlefield identification and unit cohesion. The 17th century saw colored sashes, and the English New Model Army adopted red coats. By the 18th century, the standard Portuguese infantry uniform was a **dark blue long coat** with large cuffs, white or yellow undergarments, and a **broad-brimmed tricorn hat**. Regimental identity was shown through facing colors on collars, cuffs, and turnbacks.  
* **Evolution of Firearms:** The slow matchlock was replaced by more reliable **flintlock mechanisms**. Portugal was an early innovator in flintlock design. By the 17th century, the flintlock musket replaced the arquebus, and by the 18th century, the flintlock musket with a **socket bayonet** was the universal infantry weapon. Flintlock pistols were standard for cavalry.

Life in Mazagão was characterized by **hostility and isolation**. The fortress was a self-contained, claustrophobic European outpost constantly under threat from Moroccan polities and subject to a strong blockade. It was dependent on a fragile sea supply line from Portugal and the Azores for everything from reinforcements to basic foodstuffs. **Daily duties** revolved around defense, utilizing a sophisticated alert system (*rebate*) with sentinels and scouts (*atalaias*). Foraging parties for water, timber, hay, and cattle were the most dangerous routine tasks, often leading to conflict. Alarms involved church bells and flags, signaling immediate retreat within the walls. **Pay** for professional soldiers was inconsistent, and soldiers often had to purchase their own equipment, sometimes taking extra work. **Rations** were monotonous and non-perishable: ship's biscuit, salted beef/pork, dried fish, legumes, cheese, olive oil, vinegar, and wine. **Living conditions** were cramped, unsanitary, and prone to disease, with high mortality, suicides, and desertions. **Leisure activities** included religious services, swordsmanship for nobility, and games of chance, music, and singing for common soldiers. The constant duress created a hardened, cynical, pragmatic garrison fiercely loyal to comrades.

The Portuguese employed a dual **military doctrine**. **Defensively**, Mazagão was a Renaissance star fort, a masterpiece of engineering built between 1541 and 1548\. Its **bastioned defense** with four angular bastions eliminated dead zones and provided interlocking fields of fire, making approach suicidal for attackers. Walls were low, thick, and inclined to deflect cannonballs, surrounded by a seawater-filled moat. **Offensively**, lacking manpower for conventional conquest, the Portuguese perfected **guerra guerreada** (guerrilla war). The **Cavalgada** (raid) was a fast-moving operation by light cavalry (*ginetes*) and light infantry (crossbowmen/arquebusiers) to pillage, capture prisoners, and terrorize the countryside. The **Torna Fuye** (feigned retreat) was a classic ambush tactic. **Amphibious Assaults (*Saltos*)** involved landing infantry by ship for surprise coastal attacks. These combined-arms operations honed skills in siegecraft and asymmetrical warfare, proving valuable throughout the Portuguese Empire.

The **Moroccan adversaries** of the Portuguese, under the Wattasid (1472–1554) and Saadian (1510–1659) dynasties, were sophisticated and evolving military powers.

* **Military Organization:** Moroccan armies combined professional, salaried soldiers (like the elite **Makhzaniyyah** cavalry, who policed frontiers and enforced the Sultan's authority) with larger numbers of tribal levies. The Saadi dynasty, rising through *jihad* against the Portuguese, effectively modernized its army by integrating gunpowder weapons and adopting Ottoman-influenced tactics, which were decisive in expelling the Portuguese from strongholds like Agadir in 1541\.  
* **Arms and Armor:** Moroccan equipment prioritized speed and mobility. **Armor** was typically lighter, often mail shirts reinforced with steel plates (*jawshan* or *krug*). **Helmets** were distinctively Islamic, conical or bulbous "turban" shapes, often with a nasal bar and a mail curtain (*aventail*) for neck protection, sometimes engraved with Quranic verses. Lighter troops used padded or leather armor, or fought unarmored. **Shields** were critical, notably the **adarga** (heart or double-oval shaped, made of tough leather) or large round shields of hide or metal. **Weapons** included the **scimitar** (curved, single-edged blade), with local variants called **nimcha** often fitted with imported European blades and local hilts. Lances, spears, and javelins were also common. Moroccans actively adopted **firearms** (cannons, arquebuses), becoming proficient users through trade and Ottoman/European renegade influence, using them effectively in sieges and battles like Alcacer Quibir. The traditional **composite bow** also remained in use.  
* **Tactics:** Moroccan tactics centered on **cavalry dominance**, with light cavalry mastering skirmishing and hit-and-run. They were adept at **guerrilla warfare**, using their numbers and terrain knowledge for ambushes and raids. While initially struggling with siegecraft, the Saadis quickly adopted modern siege techniques, constructing siege forts (*kasbahs*) and using heavy cannons. The conflict was a "crucible of military innovation," with both sides adapting to the other's strengths.

These historical details offer actionable insights for game design.

* **Character Classes/Archetypes:** Portuguese factions could include *Fidalgo* (officer/tank), *Soldado* (pikeman/arquebusier), *Ginete* (light cavalry), *Montanteiro* (greatsword specialist), and *Besteiro* (crossbowman). Moroccan factions could feature *Makhzaniyyah* Lancer (elite cavalry), Tribal Warrior (basic infantry with shield/javelins), Saadi Arquebusier (ranged firepower), and Nimcha Swordsman (agile melee).  
* **Visual Design:** A "lived-in" aesthetic for the Portuguese garrison, with worn armor and faded uniforms, would reflect their isolated deployment. Environmental storytelling through Mazagão's architecture (late-Gothic churches contrasting with stark Renaissance walls) and symbolism (Cross of the Order of Christ for Portuguese, geometric patterns/Quranic calligraphy for Moroccans) can enhance authenticity.  
* **Gameplay Mechanics:** A core loop could involve **Siege Defense** (static, using fortress architecture/artillery) and **Guerrilla Warfare** (mobile raids for resources into a dangerous open world). **Supply lines** could be a central mechanic, with finite resources and missions to escort supply ships or disrupt enemy logistics. Mission designs could draw directly from historical tactics like the *torna fuye* (feigned retreat) or *salto* (coastal raid). An **evolving enemy AI** that adapts its tactics based on the player's success would create a dynamic strategic challenge, mirroring the historical arms race.

Moroccan post-colonial literature actively engages with the public sphere, creating a dynamic relationship where models of public debate and aesthetic norms are explored. This engagement fosters public spaces for **subaltern concerns**, tests and expands the boundaries of public liberties, serves as a forum for public debate, and initiates discussions on matters of general interest. The ultimate goal is to trace how Moroccan and, more broadly, North African literature has interacted with local cultural and political landscapes during both colonial rule and the post-colonial era.

Historically, literature in colonized and post-colonial nations has been instrumental in the **struggle for liberation and independence**, the formation of national cultural identity, and the solidification of communal bonds, even contributing to the expansion of national identity beyond geographical borders. Beyond these functions, literature also performs a **"subversive" role**, critiquing the very national identity it helps construct. Despite its importance, literature in post-colonial Morocco has faced marginalization in educational curricula and public media, and research into its role in the public sphere has been limited. Nevertheless, Moroccan literature has consistently been regarded as "serious business," central to ongoing debates concerning the representation of national culture, the conditions of its representation, and its relationship with the country's language, history, and identity. The term "post-colonial" in this context encompasses the period during and after European imperial domination, focusing on enduring concerns such as the dialectic between past and present, modernity and tradition, language and identity, heritage and authenticity, and the pursuit of a national literary aesthetic. Morocco is considered a former French colony, acknowledging that while there might be slight differences from a protectorate, the colonizer's objectives and the histories of colonized peoples were largely similar.

Theoretical frameworks highlight literature's powerful role in resistance and identity formation. In *Resistance Literature*, Harlow (1987) argues that **resistance literature is a political and politicized activity** that actively challenges dominant ideological and cultural production. It uses poetic imagery and narratives to analyze power structures, thereby committing to the future by reconstructing interrupted histories. Jusdanis (1991), in *Belated Modernity and Aesthetic Culture*, shifts focus from the text itself to the **people's appropriation and interpretation** of it as the source of resistance. For Jusdanis, literature plays a crucial role in constructing cultural identities, serving as "the nation's diary" by narrating its past, present, and future. Examples from Morocco illustrate this: a 1950s folk song, "shibani," primarily about eroticism, was transformed by the public into a **satirical commentary against the French-imposed sultan**, leading to its ban. Similarly, the popular band Nass al Ghiwane's 1970s-80s song "mahamouni ghir er-rjal ila da 'u," intended by the artist to be about friendship, was interpreted by fans as a **subversive critique of state repression** and the curtailment of public liberties. This demonstrates that in an African context, writing often necessitates a political rather than purely aesthetic understanding.

Khatibi's (1979) study of Maghrebi literature under colonial rule underscores its social significance and aesthetics, portraying it as a **"mirror" reflecting the historical consciousness of the colonized**. Francophone writers viewed their mission as depicting "the drama of a society in crisis". A challenge for resistance literature was to keep pace with changing historical realities without becoming ephemeral. Maghrebi francophone literature developed within the dominant French cultural industry, which paradoxically enabled North African writers to gain international recognition through French publishing and promotional networks, even while fighting against the colonial power. This dynamic led to disillusionment among writers post-independence, with Memmi describing it as "the natural withering of colonized literature". Khatibi favored the francophone novel for its ability to capture the complexities of North African reality, contrasting it with Arabic novels often focused on nationalist ideology and social realism. He concluded that the novel played a significant role in reflecting the contradictions of the colonial era and influencing international public opinion.

Moroccan post-colonial literature is deeply intertwined with the **construction of nationalism and Moroccan identity**. Pre-Second World War literary production saw two main trends: the reformist/Arabizing tendencies, exemplified by nationalist leader Allal al-Fassi who used traditional poetic forms to design national identity foundations, and the modernist trend, which favored journalistic writing, particularly the **short story**. The short story, mediated by the press, became a dominant genre closely linked to the independence struggle and national culture construction, addressing themes like liberation, urbanization, poverty, and social claims. The number of short story collections published significantly increased from the mid-20th century onwards.

**Women writers** have made crucial contributions, highlighting their roles in the liberation struggle and their often-subordinate position in independent Morocco. Khnata Bannuna's "Down with Silence" (1967) conveyed women's disillusionment, and her subsequent novels provided a revisionist reading of women's conditions and their disappointment with the post-colonial project. Leila Abouzeid's novella, "Year of the Elephant" (1983), symbolically links a woman's personal journey to independence with Morocco's national struggle and its attendant frustrations. Rafiqa at-Tabi'a was innovative in using Darija (Morocco's Arabic vernacular) in her works, challenging traditional aesthetics. Despite these contributions, women's literary production has remained somewhat limited in both quantity and aesthetic innovation.

During French colonial rule (1912-1956), literary output was relatively scarce, with only 82 texts across the Maghreb in French and Arabic between 1945 and 1962\. Most Maghrebi francophone novels were published by French houses, underscoring the **power imbalance** between local writers and the French cultural network. Contemporary challenges for Moroccan literature include high production costs, rising book prices, and limited public purchasing power. Cultural strategies like annual Book Fairs, prizes, and partnerships between Moroccan and French publishers aim to enhance visibility and accessibility. Khatibi identified three thematic phases in literature from 1945 to 1962:

1. **Ethnographic Novel (1945-1953):** Writers revisited themes of colonial travel writers from their own perspective, focusing on "traditional society." This approach was often criticized as "conservative" for not directly challenging colonization.  
2. **Acculturation (1954-1958):** Characterized by protagonists grappling with **uprootedness and psychological contradictions**. Driss Chraibi's *The Simple Past* (1954) is a seminal work of this phase, portraying a revolt against both the colonizer and a fractured sense of self, an "anxious quest for self-identity".  
3. **Militant Literature (1958-1962):** Centered on the Algerian liberation war, depicting armed struggle. This genre became "obsolete" after independence, leading some to predict the decline of the Maghrebi francophone novel.

A key aspect of post-colonial literature is seen in the contrast between **Driss Chraibi's *The Simple Past*** (1954) and **Abdalkrim Ghallab's *Dafanna al-Madi*** (1966). Chraibi's novel, published during the colonial era, champions a fully democratic sphere, confronting and satirizing archaic social structures, patriarchal oppression, religious fundamentalism, colonial hypocrisy, and capitalism. His controversial stance that European colonialism was "necessary and beneficial" and served as a "catalyst for social rebirth" led to its condemnation, appropriation by colonial critics, and a ban in Morocco until 1977\. Chraibi's model promotes an **open public forum** where contradictions, conflicts, and diverse discourses—rational and superstitious—are confronted mercilessly.

In contrast, Ghallab's *Dafanna al-Madi* (1966) offers a public sphere model that **streamlines conflicts to promote a homogenized consensus**. It aims for an "ideal speech situation" where inherited values are reconciled with modern reality, and "illegitimate" relations are concealed. This model consolidates Morocco's "official" regulation of public space, fostering a "fine and bourgeois model of national culture, public debate, gender and ethnic relations and cross-cultural dialogue".

Decades after these foundational works, the **literary public sphere in Morocco has significantly expanded**. It now embraces women's literature, human rights literature, and increasingly, Moroccan gay literature. A particularly significant contribution has been the **testimonial literature from former political detainees**, such as Marzouki's *Tazmamart. Cellule 10* (2000) and Ben Jelloun's *Cette aveuglante absence de lumière* (2001), which exposed state repression and human rights abuses, lifting taboos surrounding women, human rights, and cultural diversity. This expansion coincided with important societal changes, including the passage of a new family code (2004), the report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2005), and the establishment of an institute for Amazigh culture (2001). Current debates increasingly focus on constitutional amendments to further consolidate public liberties, and more artists are experimenting with literary production in Darija, the Moroccan Arabic vernacular. This demonstrates that Moroccan national culture is actively engaged in a historical process of self-identification and awareness of societal disparities, with literature playing a vital and invigorating role. There is a close relationship between literature and history, where fictional narratives significantly contribute to social and political history.

The **Republic of Salé**, also known as the Bou Regreg Republic or the Republic of the Two Banks, was a 17th-century city-state and maritime corsair republic located at Salé, Morocco, at the mouth of the Bou Regreg river. Established in 1627 and disestablished in 1668, its primary commercial activities were the Barbary slave trade and piracy. Its common languages included Arabic, Berber, and a Spanish-based lingua franca, with all its documentation done in Spanish. The republic was founded by Moriscos, descendants of Muslims nominally converted to Christianity, who were expelled from Spain.

The origins of the republic date back to the early 17th century with the arrival of approximately 3,000 wealthy Moriscos from Hornachos, Spain, who anticipated the 1609 expulsion edicts. After 1609, about 10,000 more expelled Moriscos arrived. Due to cultural and linguistic differences with the native Salétin population, these newcomers settled in the old medina of Rabat, across the Bou Regreg river. Brahim Vargas became the first governor in 1614, enriching Rabat through piracy and trade. His descendants, the Bargach family, remain influential in Rabat. In 1624, the Dutchman Jan Janszoon, or Murad Reis, became the "Grand Admiral" of the Corsair Republic of Salé, with the Saadi Sultan Zidan Abu Maali formally appointing him as ceremonial governor.

In April 1627, with the support of Sidi al-Ayachi, the Hornacheros expelled the Sherif's governor and established a virtually independent republic. After Janszoon's departure in 1627, the Moriscos refused to recognize Sultan Zidan Abu Maali's authority or pay his tithe. They proclaimed a republic, mirroring medieval Italian city-states like Venice or Genoa, governed by a **Diwan** (council) of 12 to 14 notable individuals. This Diwan annually elected a Governor and a Captain General of the Fortalesa in May. Initially (1627-1630), the Hornacheros controlled the Diwan, causing resentment among the growing population of non-Hornachero Moriscos, known as Andalusians. Following violent clashes in 1630, an agreement led to the election of a Qaid by Andalusians and a new 16-member Diwan, equally split between Andalusians and Hornacheros.

Amidst this internal strife, the Hornacheros attempted to cede the republic to the Hispanic Monarchy of Philip IV. In 1631, they sent a draft treaty proposing to return to Hornachos and hand over Salé under several conditions: they wanted compensation for replaced neighbors, municipal authorities from their own nation to prevent past injustices, and a limited presence of Old Christians (only necessary priests and friars). They also requested that the Inquisition not punish those born in Barbary for twenty years for not being imposed on the Catholic religion, and that their old privileges and estates be respected. They offered to deliver the fortress of Salé with its 68 cannons, their privateering ships, and intelligence, including correspondence with the King of England and papers from Amsterdam burgomasters. They also proposed stripping the Jewish quarter and other Dutch and French merchant estates, promising to hand over the loot to the King in exchange for 200 pounds of gold, and requested the return of children taken during the expulsion. This proposal was signed by four Hornachero leaders. However, negotiations failed, partly due to renewed internal fighting in 1636, which saw English intervention through a bombardment of the Kasbah in support of the indigenous Marabutus faction. After 1640, the republic fell under the control of the Dilaites.

The republic entered a period of **decline**. In 1641, the Zawiya Dila'iya, which controlled much of Morocco, imposed religious hegemony over Salé. By the early 1660s, the republic was at war with the Zawiya. Ultimately, in June 1668, Sultan Moulay al-Rashid of the Alaouite dynasty vanquished the Dilaites and ended the republic's independence.

**Piracy** was a defining characteristic of the Republic of Salé, beginning with the wealthy Moors from Spain who acquired ships. They targeted mainly Spanish vessels, giving 10% of their spoils to the Saadians before their rebellion. The Salé Rovers conducted extensive operations, including an expedition into the English Channel in 1622 led by Murad Reis. In 1625, they seized captives from Plymouth, England, and in 1626, five ships off the coast of Wales. In 1627, they reached Iceland, sacking Reykjavik and raiding Grindavík in what became known as the Turkish Abductions, and attempted to raid Bessastaðir. They also captured the island of Lundy in the Bristol Channel, using it as a raiding base for five years. Their fleet captured over 40 fishing vessels in the Newfoundland banks in two years, and Salé ships appeared off the coasts of Acadia or Nova Scotia in 1624\. In 1631, Murad Reis led the Sack of Baltimore in Ireland. European agents, including Dutch and French consuls, dealt directly with the Andalusians regarding piracy and commerce.

The **legacy** of piracy in Salé persisted even after the republic's demise, although it was in decline. Sidi Mohammed III's attempt (1757-1790) to revive piracy ironically hastened the city's decline, especially with the establishment of Mogador in 1760 as a more modern port. In 1818, Sultan Moulay Slimane officially ended the "holy war" and dissolved the Sherifian Navy, definitively concluding Salé's role as a corsair city. In popular culture, the character Robinson Crusoe, in Daniel Defoe's novel, is depicted as being held captive by Salé pirates before sailing to freedom from the Salé river mouth. The anarchist writer Peter Lamborn Wilson also features the Republic of Salé in his 1995 book *Pirate Utopias: Moorish Corsairs & European Renegadoes*, viewing such pirate enclaves as early forms of autonomous, proto-anarchist societies that operated beyond government control and embraced unrestricted political freedom.

The **Saadi Sultanate**, also known as the Sharifian Sultanate, was a state led by the Saadi dynasty that ruled present-day Morocco and parts of Northwest Africa from 1510 to 1659\. This Arab Sharifian dynasty successfully resisted Ottoman expansion, making Morocco the only part of North Africa to remain outside Ottoman suzerainty, and established a model of political-religious legitimacy that continued under the later 'Alawi dynasty. The Saadian period is considered a significant chapter in Moroccan history, marking the beginning of a modern Moroccan national identity with more clearly defined territorial borders and increased international recognition.

The **Saadi dynasty claimed descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad** through Ali ibn Abi Talib and Fatima Zahra. They were established in the Draa River valley by the early 14th century and later settled in Tidsi in the Sous valley. Their rise to power began in 1510 amidst weak central rule in Morocco by the Wattasid dynasty and significant Portuguese expansion along the Atlantic coast. **Muhammad al-Qa'im** was recognized as the military leader and political representative by the tribes of the Sous and Sufi groups in 1510 to oppose European presence. He moved his base to Afughal in 1513, linking the early Saadians with the followers of al-Jazuli and opposition to the Wattasids. Upon his death in 1517, his sons Ahmad al-'Araj and Muhammad al-Shaykh took over, becoming the true founders of the dynasty. Ahmad al-'Araj captured **Marrakesh** in 1524 or 1525, which symbolically became a spiritual and political capital for the Saadians. In 1527, the Wattasids recognized Saadian rule over southern Morocco through the **Treaty of Tadla**, roughly partitioning the country along the Oum Er-Rbia River. Muhammad al-Shaykh further solidified Saadian power by capturing Agadir from the Portuguese in 1541, leading to the collapse of Portuguese colonial power in the region and enhancing his reputation. After a conflict with his brother, Muhammad al-Shaykh became the sole Saadian ruler. He then conquered **Fes** in 1549, effectively ending Wattasid rule and making him the sole ruler of Morocco. This set the stage for a confrontation with the **Ottoman Empire**, which had expanded into Algeria. After initial skirmishes and a brief Ottoman installation of a Wattasid ruler, Muhammad al-Shaykh decisively retook Fes in 1554\. He was assassinated in 1557, reportedly on the orders of the Ottoman sultan, after refusing Ottoman suzerainty and seeking an anti-Ottoman alliance with Spain.

The **apogee of Saadian power and wealth** occurred during the 24-year reign of **Ahmad al-Mansur (1578-1603)**. He ascended the throne after the decisive Saadian victory at the **Battle of Alcácer Quibir (or "Battle of the Three Kings") in 1578**, where the Portuguese intervention was thoroughly defeated. The significant ransoms from captured Portuguese nobility, along with control of the sugar trade, filled the state's coffers, earning al-Mansur the title "ad-Dhahabi" ("the Golden") and allowing him to mint high-quality gold coins. Al-Mansur modernized his army along Ottoman lines, adopting firearms and artillery, and employed Turkish titles and terms. He insisted on an efficient state administration and was a patron of culture, commissioning the lavish **El Badi Palace** in Marrakesh and sponsoring poets, musicians, and scholars. His relations with the Ottoman Empire were ambivalent; he initially recognized Ottoman suzerainty but later asserted his independence, minted coins in his own name, and even proclaimed himself caliph. He also pursued careful diplomatic relations with European powers, notably developing an **Anglo-Moroccan alliance** with England to counter Spain, focusing on trade in commodities like saltpeter, cloth, and sugar, and even discussing a potential invasion of Spain.

Al-Mansur's major foreign military venture was the **invasion of the Western Sudan**, particularly the Songhai Empire, in 1590-1591. This was likely motivated by a desire to control the gold mines, increase access to slaves for the sugar industry, and elevate his claim as a universal Muslim ruler. The Saadian army, led by Judar Pasha, defeated the Songhai at the Battle of Tondibi, occupying Gao and Timbuktu. Although Moroccan control was tenuous and short-lived after al-Mansur's death, the conquered region annually sent riches, including gold, slaves, and ivory, to Marrakesh.

The **decline of the Saadian Sultanate** began after Ahmad al-Mansur's death from plague in 1603, leading to a **succession war (1603-1627)** among his three sons: Muhammad al-Sheikh al-Ma'mun, Abu al-Ma'ali Zaydan al-Nasir (Moulay Zaydan), and Abdallah al-Wathiq (Abu Faris). The realm fragmented, with Marrakesh and Fes often ruled by rival factions. Moulay Zaydan eventually ruled from Marrakesh, while Al-Ma'mun's sons ruled Fes. Al-Ma'mun's decision to cede the northern port city of Larache to Spain in exchange for military aid severely damaged the Saadian dynasty's credibility. The civil war also saw the rise of local religious leaders and chieftains, such as Abu Mahalli, who rebelled against Moulay Zaydan. The Saadian realm was nominally reunified under **Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik II** in 1627, but central authority continued to decline. Control over the Sudan territories was relinquished, leading to the formation of the Pashalik of Timbuktu, and the important sugar mills in southern Morocco also declined. Independent political entities and opposition groups emerged, including the **Republic of Bou Regreg** formed by Morisco exiles in Salé and Rabat, which became a significant piracy base. The **Dala'iyya Sufi brotherhood** in the Middle Atlas grew in power, establishing a new Berber state and even engaging in foreign relations, capturing Fes in 1641\. The last Saadian sultan, Ahmad al-Abbas, was assassinated in 1659, ending the dynasty, with the 'Alawi dynasty eventually conquering Marrakesh in 1668 to establish new rule over Morocco.

The Saadian period brought significant **social and demographic changes** to Morocco. Large waves of emigrants and refugees from the Iberian Peninsula, including **Andalusi Muslims and Sephardic Jews**, settled in the country after 1492 and the subsequent expulsions. These arrivals revitalized northern cities like Tétouan and profoundly impacted the Jewish community, increasing its population and cultural activity while creating ethnic divisions that later blended. The population also included **Christian European captives**, many working on construction projects or in armament production, and thousands of **sub-Saharan Africans** brought as slaves from the Sudan conquest. Additionally, **Turkish or Ottoman mercenaries and soldiers** were present due to regional geopolitics. Many of these new arrivals were tied to state operations and, after the Saadian decline, some played independent roles, like the corsairs of Salé.

Under the Saadians, particularly Ahmad al-Mansur, the **central government's authority became more absolute**, marking a new stage in the development of the **Makhzen** (the royal government). The status of the sovereign ruler became increasingly associated with that of a **sharif** (descendant of Muhammad), a concept that became irreversible under the succeeding 'Alawi dynasty. This era is also seen by some scholars as the **beginning of a modern Moroccan national identity**, with more defined territorial borders and international recognition, and the name "Morocco" becoming commonly used abroad to designate the country.

**Culturally, the Saadian dynasty refined the existing Moroccan-Moorish architectural style**, with some scholars considering it the last "renaissance" of this style. Notable architectural examples include the ornate **Saadian Tombs** in Marrakesh, the **Ben Youssef Madrasa**, and the Mouassine and Bab Doukkala Mosques in Marrakesh. These mosques were part of larger civic complexes with various institutions and amenities for local residents. The lavish **El Badi Palace**, famous for its imported Italian marble, was also constructed by Ahmad al-Mansur. The usage of **zellij** (mosaic tilework) became more widespread and complex, with examples from the Saadian Tombs considered among the best. From the Saadian period onwards, Moroccan art and architecture largely became "conservative," reproducing existing styles without major new innovations.

In terms of **manuscripts and calligraphy**, the Saadian sultans compiled large libraries, particularly during Ahmad al-Mansur's reign, acquiring numerous Ottoman and Middle Eastern manuscripts. The **Zaydani Library**, a major collection of royal manuscripts, was captured by the Spanish in 1612 and is now kept in the library of El Escorial. It includes a richly produced royal Qur'an from 1599, commissioned by Ahmad al-Mansur. Another richly decorated royal Qur'an, commissioned by Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib and dated to 1568, is held by the British Library. While largely preserving Andalusi-Maghrebi artistic traditions, there was experimentation with eastern traditions, such as the systematized use of Maghrebi thuluth script and the incorporation of Ottoman floral motifs like the tulip. The Dala'il al-Khayrat, a collection of prayers for Muhammad by al-Jazuli, was also a popular text transcribed during this period.

The rulers of the Saadi Sultanate included:

* **Rise to power (1510–1549)**: Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman Abu Abdallah al-Qaim (1510–17), Ahmad al-Araj (1517–44), and Muhammad al-Shaykh (1544–49, after being viceroy in the Sous).  
* **Sultans of Morocco (1549–1603)**: Muhammad al-Shaykh (1549–57), Abdallah al-Ghalib (1557–74), Abu Abdallah Mohammed II al-Mutawakkil (1574–76), Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik I (1576–78), and Ahmad al-Mansur (1578–1603).  
* **Succession War (1603–1627)**: Key figures ruling from Marrakesh included Abu Faris Abdallah al-Wathiq (1603–06), Abdallah al-Ghalib II (1606–09), and Abu al-Ma'ali Zaydan al-Nasir (1609–27). Rulers from Fes included Abu al-Ma'ali Zaydan al-Nasir (1603–04), Muhammad al-Sheikh al-Ma'mun (1604–06, contested until 1613), Abu Faris Abdallah al-Wathiq (1606–09), Abdallah al-Ghalib II (1609–23), and Abd al-Malik al-Mu'tasim (1623–27).  
* **Reunified Rule and Decline (1627–1659)**: Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik II (1627–31), Muhammad al-Walid (1631–36), Muhammad al-Sheikh al-Saghir (1636–55), and Ahmad al-Abbas (1655–59).

The history of Morocco is intricately linked with the legacy of its **sultans**, who have governed the nation through centuries, profoundly influencing its identity, culture, art, and architecture. These monarchs have been pivotal in establishing Morocco as a significant player in African and global contexts, with various dynasties leaving unique marks on the country.

### **Historical Background and Origins of the Sultanate**

The origins of the Sultanate of Morocco can be traced back to the **8th century** with the establishment of the **Idrisid dynasty** by Idris I, a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. Idris I founded the first Moroccan state in Volubilis, unifying local Berber tribes under Islam and establishing governance based on Islamic principles. The Idrisids laid the foundation for future sultanates by promoting Islam, developing a distinct Moroccan identity by blending Arab and Berber cultures, and establishing trade routes. Over centuries, the Sultanate adapted to challenges like foreign invasions and internal strife, maintaining autonomy through negotiations with regional tribes and foreign powers. The establishment of the Sultanate as a hereditary monarchy provided stability but also led to power struggles.

### **Major Dynasties and Their Contributions**

Morocco's history is characterized by several influential ruling dynasties:

* **Idrisids**: The first Moroccan dynasty, they set the precedent for Islamic governance, promoting Islamic scholarship and the Arabic language as the *lingua franca*, and developing trade routes.  
* **Almoravids**: Emerging in the 11th century, they unified the Maghreb and parts of Spain through military prowess and zeal in spreading Islam. Their architectural contributions include the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakech.  
* **Almohads**: Succeeding the Almoravids in the 12th century, they emphasized reforming Islamic practices, expanded Moroccan territory significantly into modern-day Portugal and southern France, and left architectural legacies such as the Hassan Tower in Rabat and the Giralda in Seville.  
* **Saadians**: Ruling in the 16th and early 17th centuries, this dynasty marked a **golden age** by successfully repelling Portuguese and Spanish incursions, thus reinforcing Morocco's sovereignty. They also fostered a flourishing of arts and culture, especially under Sultan Ahmed al-Mansur, who commissioned the Saadian Tombs in Marrakech.  
* **Alaouites**: The current ruling dynasty since the 17th century, they played a crucial role in **modernizing Morocco** and maintaining its independence during the colonial period. Under Sultan Mohammed V and Hassan II, Morocco underwent significant reforms, modernizing its political and social structures while preserving cultural heritage.

### **The Role of Religion in Sultanate Governance**

Religion has been a cornerstone of governance in Morocco, deeply intertwining with the monarchy's authority. Sultans are regarded as both political and religious leaders, bearing the title "**Amir al-Mu'minin**" (Commander of the Faithful), which entrusts them with protecting Islam and its followers and reinforces their legitimacy. Islamic faith, particularly **sharia law**, has served as a foundation for Moroccan law and customs. Sultans historically used religious legitimacy to consolidate power, often aligning with influential religious leaders. For instance, Almohad sultans utilized religious zeal to justify military campaigns and territorial expansion, known for their strict adherence to Islamic orthodoxy. In contemporary Morocco, the monarchy continues to emphasize its role as protector of Islam, with King Mohammed VI initiating reforms to modernize religious institutions, promote tolerance, combat extremism, and foster dialogue among Islamic schools of thought. This intertwining of religion and governance has created a unique political landscape where the monarchy is seen as a stabilizing force.

### **Prominent Sultans and Their Legacies**

Three significant sultans have profoundly shaped Morocco's history, culture, politics, and identity:

* **Sultan Moulay Ismail (1672-1727)**: Known as "The Warrior King," his reign was marked by robust military campaigns aimed at consolidating power and repelling foreign influences. He successfully reclaimed coastal cities like Tangier from foreign control and established the **Black Guard**, a loyal military unit crucial for suppressing dissent and maintaining his rule. Architecturally, he transformed Meknes into a grand imperial capital with structures like the Bab Mansour gate and the royal palace. He also implemented a **centralized administration** to unify diverse regions, setting a precedent for future Moroccan governance.  
* **Sultan Mohammed V (1927-1961)**: "The Modernizer" was a pivotal figure in Morocco's struggle for independence from French protectorate rule. He became a **symbol of resistance**, promoting Moroccan nationalism and uniting various political factions, notably with his famous call for independence in the 1940s. After Morocco achieved independence in 1956, his leadership solidified his status as a national hero, and he worked to establish a constitutional monarchy. His reign also saw significant **social reforms**, including investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, as well as a commitment to religious tolerance and cultural preservation.  
* **Sultan Hassan I (1873-1894)**: Regarded as "The Architect of Modern Morocco," Hassan I focused on **modernizing the country** while preserving its cultural heritage. He implemented military reforms, establishing a modern army with contemporary weaponry and tactics to bolster national defense. He also prioritized **education**, establishing schools that taught both religious and secular subjects to cultivate a literate populace. Diplomatically, Hassan I skillfully navigated complex relationships with European powers, asserting Moroccan sovereignty and positioning Morocco as a respected player on the global stage. His commitment to cultural heritage is evident in his architectural commissions of mosques, schools, and public buildings.

The legacies of these sultans emphasize national unity, cultural heritage, social reform, strong leadership, resilience, and adaptability, continuing to influence modern Moroccan society.

### **Cultural Impact of the Sultans on Moroccan Society**

The sultans have significantly shaped Morocco's cultural fabric, leaving a rich and diverse legacy in art, architecture, literature, and identity formation.

* **Architectural Contributions and Landmarks**: The sultans commissioned grand palaces, mosques, and fortifications, also investing in urban planning and infrastructure. Notable examples include the **Hassan II Mosque** in Casablanca, a modern architectural marvel completed in 1993, symbolizing national pride. The **Royal Palace of Marrakech** exemplifies Moroccan grandeur with its intricate *zellij* tile work and lush gardens. Defensive structures like the **Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou**, built during Almoravid and Almohad reigns, are UNESCO World Heritage Sites showcasing architectural ingenuity.  
* **Influence on Moroccan Art and Literature**: Under royal patronage, Moroccan art flourished, blending traditional techniques with new ideas from trade. **Calligraphy** reached new heights, adorning religious texts and public spaces, with the Almoravid dynasty emphasizing its role in religious devotion. In literature, the 14th century saw the emergence of historical chronicles and poetry, with figures like Ibn al-Khatib and Al-Maqqari intertwining history with poetic expression. Literary salons at royal courts fostered intellectual exchange and creativity.  
* **Role in Moroccan Identity Formation**: The Sultanate has been crucial in shaping a unified Moroccan identity, acting as a symbol of authority and continuity and embodying the nation's values. Sultans historically mediated between diverse ethnic and cultural groups (Arab, Berber, etc.). During the colonial period, sultans like **Sultan Mohammed V** became symbols of resistance, rallying the population around sovereignty and independence. In contemporary Morocco, King Mohammed VI continues to balance modernization with historical significance, promoting unity and pride in Moroccan heritage.

The profound and multifaceted cultural impact of the sultans, through their architectural contributions, artistic patronage, and role in identity formation, continues to resonate in Moroccan society.

The **Maghrawa (بنو مغراوة)** were a prominent Zenata Berber tribe, recognized as the "big bosses" of Zenata politics, surpassing the Miknasa and Banū Ifrān in strength. They successfully ruled Fez and a significant portion of Morocco for approximately a century. Throughout their dominance, they maintained strong loyalty to the Umayyads of Córdoba, effectively acting as their "Moroccan viceroys" until their eventual subjugation by the Almoravids. Their territories encompassed Taza, Fez, Sijilmasa, Tadla, and the western Maghreb. Initially adhering to Kharijism, they later converted to Sunni Maliki Islam under the sponsorship of the Umayyads. Their period of influence spanned from the late 8th century until the 1060s, when they were absorbed into the Almoravid empire.

The chronological lineage of Maghrawa leaders illustrates their rise and eventual decline. In their early phase, pre-Umayyad dominance, figures like **al-Khazar ibn Hafṣ al-Maghrawī** (late 8th century) established a Maghrawa presence in Tlemcen and the central Maghreb, sometimes allying with the Idrissids. **Maymūn ibn Ziyād al-Maghrawī** (early 9th century) was linked with other Zenata tribes, the Rustamids, and early Kharijite networks. The Maghrawa's ascent under the Umayyads began with **Muḥammad ibn Khazar al-Maghrawī** (early 10th century), who extended control over Taza and approaches to Fez, eventually leaning towards the Umayyads despite earlier alliances with Idrissids. **Muḥammad ibn al-Khayr al-Maghrawī** (mid-10th century) was an important warlord who wavered between Umayyad and Fatimid influence.

By around 950 CE, **Muḥammad ibn al-Khayr’s successors** pushed the Idrissids out of Fez, marking the Maghrawa's direct control over the city. The "superstar" of the dynasty was **Zīrī ibn ʿAṭiyya al-Maghrawī** (r. 978–1001 CE). He expanded Maghrawa rule from Fez to Sijilmasa, initially allied with the Umayyads of Córdoba. Although he briefly leaned towards the Fatimids, he ultimately broke away, ruling almost independently. His conflict with Almanzor, the Umayyad vizier, weakened him, but he left behind a strong, though unstable, kingdom upon his death in 1001\. His son, **Khazrūn ibn Zīrī al-Maghrawī** (early 11th century), maintained Fez and parts of Morocco under Umayyad suzerainty, with his descendants later shifting eastward. **Ḥammāma ibn Zīrī al-Maghrawī** (mid-11th century) was the last powerful Maghrawa emir in Morocco, ruling Fez and Sijilmasa, but he was ultimately weakened by rising Sanhaja tribes allied with the Almoravids.

The decline of the Maghrawa occurred around 1050–1069 CE, as their rule fragmented into local rulers in Fez, Tadla, and Taza. They were eventually defeated by the Almoravids under Yūsuf ibn Tāshfīn around 1069 and were absorbed into the burgeoning Almoravid empire. In summary, the Maghrawa, especially under Zīrī ibn ʿAṭiyya, came close to establishing a "Zenata kingdom of Morocco". Their legitimacy was primarily derived from their alliance with the Umayyads of Córdoba. They were constantly engaged in rivalries, fighting against the Idrissids, Banū Ifrān, and Miknasa. Unlike the Banū Ifrān who were often rebels and the Miknasa who acted as mercenaries, the Maghrawa functioned as de facto kings of Fez on behalf of the Umayyads until their ultimate defeat by the Almoravids in the late 11th century.

The **Miknasa (بنو مكناسة)** were a prominent Zenata Berber tribe, often characterized as "politically slippery" due to their strategic alliances. They are historically associated with the city of Meknès, which derives its name from the tribe. The Miknasa served as crucial intermediaries between the Idrissids, Fatimids, and Umayyads throughout their period of influence.

Their **origins** trace back to the Zenata Berbers, and their territories extended through Taza, Meknès, parts of northern Morocco, and at times, into Tlemcen. Initially, they adhered to **Kharijite Sufrī Islam**, but their allegiances shifted towards Sunni Islam depending on their patrons. The Miknasa's active timeline ranged from the late 8th century until the mid-11th century, when they were ultimately absorbed into the expanding Almoravid empire.

The **chronology of Miknasa leaders** reflects their fluctuating political landscape. In their early formation, ʿIsā ibn Yazīd al-Miknāsī, one of their earliest chiefs, briefly allied with the Idrissids while also showing loyalty to the Umayyads. Another early figure, ʿAbd al-Rahmān ibn Rustam al-Miknāsī, was linked to Kharijite networks. The Miknasa's prominence increased during the weakening of the Idrissid dynasty. **Masāla ibn Ḥabbūs al-Miknāsī** (d. 924 CE) was a pivotal leader who initially supported the Idrissids in Fez before switching allegiance to the Fatimids around 917–922 CE. He became the Fatimids' main general in Morocco, successfully overthrew the Idrissid ruler in Fez, and established Fatimid dominance in central Morocco. His son, Ḥabbūs ibn Masāla al-Miknāsī, continued his father's Fatimid allegiance, although the Miknasa began to lose ground as the Umayyads of Córdoba launched counterattacks.

During the mid-10th century, Miknasa leaders like **Ḥumayd ibn Yasal al-Miknāsī** frequently shifted between Fatimid and Umayyad patrons, controlling the vital Taza–Meknès corridor, which was a key route between Fez and Tlemcen. **Khazrūn ibn Fulful al-Miknāsī** (d. 1000 CE) was another significant Miknasa leader who also recognized both Umayyad and Fatimid suzerainty at different times. His descendants, known as the Banū Khazrūn, later expanded eastward to rule Tripoli in Libya.

The **decline** of the Miknasa began in the early 11th century, marked by an eastward shift and fragmentation. Al-ʿAskar ibn Khazrūn al-Miknāsī controlled parts of Tripoli after 1000 CE. By the time the Almoravids began their rise in the 1050s–1060s, the Miknasa in Morocco had fractured into numerous local chieftains in areas like Meknès and Taza. They were gradually absorbed by the Almoravid conquest.

In summary, the Miknasa were characterized as "political mercenaries" or brokers, often acting as the decisive factor between the Fatimids and Umayyads. While Masāla ibn Ḥabbūs represented their peak, breaking Idrissid power in Fez, they never managed to establish a lasting independent empire. Their decline, like that of the Banū Ifrān and Maghrawa, occurred because they could not resist the unifying force of the Almoravids.

The **Banū Ifrān (بنو يفرن)** were a prominent Zenata Berber tribe, often characterized as "rebellious" in the medieval Maghrib. They were known for their shifting loyalties, sometimes aligning with the Umayyads, sometimes with the Fatimids, and at other times operating independently through raids.

Their **origins** are rooted in the Zenata Berbers. Initially, they adhered to **Kharijite (Sufrite) Islam**, though many later adopted Sunni Islam. The Banū Ifrān established emirates in various locations, including **Tlemcen** (Algeria, 8th–11th century) and the **Salé (Shallat) & Tadla region** (Morocco, 10th–11th century). Their period of influence spanned from approximately **740 CE**, marked by the Berber Revolt, until their defeat by the Almoravids in **1066 CE**.

Several leaders shaped the Banū Ifrān's history:

* **Early Kharijite Leaders**: **Abu Qurra al-Ifrānī**, who ruled from around 740–760 CE, led the Banū Ifrān in the Berber Revolt against the Umayyads and established a base in Tlemcen. Another significant Kharijite rebel, **Abu Yazid al-Nukkārī**, known as "the Donkey Rider," was an ally supported by the Ifrān, active from 928–947 CE.  
* **Tlemcen Emirate**: **Yazīd ibn ʿUmar ibn Ifrān**, a successor to Abu Qurra, expanded their rule around Tlemcen. **Abu Ḥamza ibn Yazīd** continued Ifrānid rule in Tlemcen, sometimes acknowledging the Idrissids. **Abu Zakariyyāʾ Yafran ibn Abī’l-ʿĀfiya** (died around 955 CE) was a rival of the Fatimids who briefly captured Fez but was later expelled.  
* **Moroccan Emirate (Salé & Tadla)**: **Yaʿlā ibn Muhammad al-Ifrānī** ruled Salé in the mid-10th century, notably shifting his allegiance between the Umayyads of Córdoba and the Fatimids of Ifriqiya. His successor in Salé was **Abu’l-Kamāl Tamīm ibn Yaʿlā** (died 1039), who was known for resisting both the Maghrawa and the Fatimids. The last prominent Ifrānid emir in Morocco was **Abu’l-Hasan ʿAlī ibn Tamīm**, who ruled from 1039 to 1066 and defended Salé until his defeat by the Almoravids in 1066\.

Key characteristics of the Banū Ifrān included their **Kharijite (Ibāḍī/Sufrī) roots**, which led to them being viewed as "heretics" by Sunni and Fatimid powers. They were adept at **guerrilla desert warfare**, leveraging their nomadic strength. Their strategy often involved **allegiance-shifting**, playing the Fatimids against the Umayyads to ensure their survival. Ultimately, the Banū Ifrān were subdued and absorbed by the **Almoravids**, who unified Morocco, bringing an end to their independent emirates. They remained perpetual rebels, never fully submitting to either Umayyad or Fatimid control, until the Almoravid conquest.

The **Emirate of Sijilmāsa** was a significant historical entity, renowned as the **"legendary gate to the Sahara"** and the northern terminus of the **gold trade route from Ghana**.

The emirate was **founded in 757 CE (140 AH)** by **ʿĪsā ibn Mazyād al-Midrār**, a Berber from the Miknasa tribe. His dynasty became known as the **Banū Midrār**. This powerful emirate endured for nearly three centuries, until its **fall in 1055 CE** to the rising **Almoravids**.

Throughout its existence, the Banū Midrār rulers of Sijilmāsa were characterized by their strategic political maneuvering, constantly **shifting allegiance between Córdoba (representing the Umayyads) and Ifriqiya (representing the Fatimids)**. The chronological list of rulers, based on historical accounts, details a succession of leaders. **ʿĪsā ibn Mazyād al-Midrār** was the founder (757–772 CE), and his lineage continued through numerous successors, including **Abu’l-Yaqzān Muhammad ibn ʿAbdallāh** (840–883 CE) and **ʿAlī ibn Muhammad** (883–909 CE), during whose era Sijilmāsa frequently oscillated between Umayyad and Fatimid alliances. The dynasty concluded with **al-Mutawakkil ibn al-Mansūr**, who ruled from 1053 to 1055 CE. He was the last emir, captured and executed by the Almoravids under Abu Bakr ibn ʿUmar.

By the 11th century, the Sijilmāsa Emirate was weakened by **internal strife**, which made it vulnerable and "easy prey" for the burgeoning Almoravid movement. Its eventual conquest by the Almoravids in 1055 CE marked the end of the Banū Midrār dynasty's rule.

This timeline tells the story of Morocco across more than a thousand years, from antiquity and early Amazigh societies through the arrival of Islam, to the rise and fall of dynasties that shaped the country's political, religious, and cultural foundations. It concludes with the Saadians, whose rule closed a major chapter in Moroccan history. The Alaoui dynasty, the current ruling family, is not included here as it deserves its own dedicated timeline.

### **Pre-Islamic Period (1000 BCE \- 578 CE)**

Morocco's pre-Islamic past, though often overlooked in written tradition, saw the development of mighty Amazigh communities with distinct political structures. The **Phoenicians** established an early coastal presence around 1000 BCE, notably near the Strait of Gibraltar, Lixus, and Mogador, founding harbors and trading posts that integrated Morocco into Mediterranean trade networks. As Tyre fell, **Carthage** took over Phoenician influence around the 4th century BCE, establishing strongholds along the coast.

Later, ancient sources began referencing **Mauretania**, an Amazigh kingdom formed through a federation of tribes in Northern Morocco and western Algeria, with Volubilis as one of its capitals. This period marked the beginning of entanglement with Rome, as King Bocchus I allied with Rome against Jugurtha between 118-105 BCE. After Bocchus I's death, his two sons divided the kingdom and aligned with rival Roman factions. Juba I's son, Juba II, raised in Rome, was placed on the throne of Mauretania by Emperor Augustus in 25 BCE, bringing Roman influences.

In 40 CE, after Emperor Caligula assassinated Juba II's son Ptolemy, Rome annexed Mauretania, creating the province of **Mauretania Tingitana** with Tingis (Tangier) as its capital. This marked the end of native Amazigh royal rule and the start of direct Roman administration. By the 3rd century CE (around 285 CE), Roman control weakened, and Emperor Diocletian pulled the frontier back to the coast, abandoning Volubilis and creating the "Limes Tingitanus." Local Amazigh rule resurfaced, with Roman presence reduced to military outposts and coastal hubs.

Between 429-534 CE, the Germanic **Vandals** invaded the Maghreb from Iberia but bypassed Morocco, where local Amazigh communities like the Baquates near Volubilis thrived independently. In 533-534 CE, the **Byzantine Empire** attempted to restore former imperial territories, defeating the Vandals in North Africa. However, local Amazigh groups continued to resist Byzantine control through sporadic guerrilla warfare. Byzantine influence in Morocco reached no further than Ceuta, meeting fierce resistance from local Amazigh tribes, notably led by the Riffian leader Garmul between 570-578 CE. Ultimately, all attempts to restore Roman control in the region failed. This poorly documented era, locally governed by Amazigh communities with lingering Byzantine influences, is known as "the dark centuries," setting the stage for the arrival of Arab forces.

### **Islamisation (647 CE \- 750 CE)**

The Muslim conquest of North Africa began under Caliph Othman ben Affan in 647 CE, with forces capturing Tripoli and Sbeitla. By 670 CE, Kairouan was established as a major religious and military center, anchoring the spread of Islam. Between 681-683 CE, Uqba ben Nafi al Fihri, a general of the Umayyad Caliphate, led a major campaign across the Maghreb, reaching Tangier and possibly Ceuta. His control was short-lived, but he helped lay the groundwork for Islam’s spread among local Amazigh populations.

In 698 CE, the Byzantines were defeated, and Carthage fell. The resistance of the Amazigh warrior queen Dihya ("al Kahina") ended with her death. Under the Umayyad Caliphate, Musa ibn Nusayr consolidated control over North Africa and pushed westward toward the Atlantic plains of Morocco. Arab forces formally began the Islamization of Morocco between 704-715 CE, gradually taking control of Tangier, Volubilis, the Atlas Mountains, Tafilalet, and the Draa Valley. Many Amazigh tribes adopted Islam relatively quickly but continued to resist Arab political domination through frequent revolts. By 708 CE, Morocco was formally integrated into the Umayyad Caliphate based in Damascus.

Between 710-715 CE, under Musa ibn Nusayr's command, the Amazigh general Tariq ben Ziyad (governor of Tangier) crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and launched the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. Backed by local Amazigh leaders and many Amazigh warriors, he defeated the Visigothic forces, opening the door to Islamic rule in Spain. In the early 8th century, Kharijite Muslims, who promoted an egalitarian interpretation of Islam, settled in Sijilmassa. Their ideas resonated with Amazigh communities frustrated by Arab domination, leading to uprisings and the formation of independent Amazigh-led Muslim states, most notably Sijilmassa.

The Umayyad dynasty fell, overthrown by the Abbasids in 750 CE. This triggered further political instability in the Maghreb, which fragmented into autonomous regions. In Morocco, independent Kharijite kingdoms emerged, most notably Sijilmassa, and the region became politically detached from the authority of the central Islamic caliphate.

### **Idrisids (788-974)**

In the wake of the Abbasid takeover, the westernmost fringes of the Muslim world remained beyond their effective control. In this vacuum, an Alid fugitive, **Idris ben Abdallah**, fleeing Abbasid persecution, found refuge among the Amazigh tribe of the Awraba in northern Morocco in 788 CE. Welcomed near Volubilis, he was proclaimed Imam, founding the first Moroccan Muslim dynasty, the Idrisids.

Idris I expanded his control across northern Morocco between 789-791 CE, reaching Taza in the East, the Atlantic plains, and Tadla in the south. This marked the foundation of Morocco's first independent Islamic state, benefiting from alliances with tribes like the Meknassa, Ghomara, and Nefrata. In 791 CE, Idris I was assassinated by poison, likely on the orders of Abbasid Caliph Harun al Rachid, who saw him as a threat due to his growing influence and prophetic lineage.

After Idris I's death, his Amazigh wife Kenza, daughter of the Awraba chief, gave birth to their son, **Idris II**. He took power at age 11 in 803 CE, after a stable transition secured by Arab regents. Idris II shifted political favor from his father’s pro-Amazigh stance to privileging Arab elites, establishing a *makhzen* (state administration) and an Arab military guard. This created growing tensions with Amazigh groups, culminating in the execution of the Awraba leader. Idris II left Volubilis and founded the city of **Fez** in 808 CE. He built his residence (Dar al-Qaytun), Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque, and the commercial district (al-Qasriyya), attracting migrants from Córdoba and al-Andalus by 814 CE. Idris II died in 829 CE under mysterious circumstances, likely poisoned. During his reign, he conquered Nafis, Aghmat, and Tlemcen.

After Idris II's death, decentralized rule began between 829-848 CE, as his ten sons governed their provinces independently. His eldest son, Sidi Mohammed, held only symbolic authority, leading to the fragmentation and unraveling of Idrisid unity. Yahya II, son of Sidi Mohammed, neglected central authority, further weakening the dynasty and sparking internal conflicts, leading to his deposition and a civil war among Idrisid princes. The Kharijite Mediouna, an Amazigh tribe, temporarily occupied Fez in the late 9th century.

In 909 CE, the Fatimid dynasty was founded, and backed by the Amazigh Koutama tribe, they eventually captured Fez. The last Idrisid princes, holding out in the Tangier region, were defeated in 947 CE by forces sent from Muslim Spain—the Umayyads of Córdoba, who were rivals of the Fatimids. The Umayyads installed a garrison in Sebta (Ceuta), bringing the Idrisid dynasty to an official end. This period also marked the beginning of Zenata (Amazigh tribe) dominance in Morocco, which would last until the rise of the Almoravids. The Idrisid legacy was more symbolic than imperial; later dynasties often looked to them for spiritual legitimacy, turning the idea of descent from the Prophet into a political asset.

### **Almoravids (1040-1147)**

In the 11th century, as North Africa remained politically fragmented after the fall of the Idrisids, new religious movements emerged. In 1039 CE, Yahya ben Ibrahim, chief of the Amazigh Juddala tribe, returned from Mecca transformed and recruited **Abdallah ben Yassine**, a Maliki jurist, to purify Islam in the Sahara. Together, they founded the Almoravid movement. Abdallah ben Yassine preached a strict, ascetic form of Islam, and after being rejected by the Juddala, he retreated to the Adrar region. There, he established a *ribat* to train warrior-monks who became known as *al Murabitun* (Almoravids), blending faith, discipline, and militancy.

Joined by Yahya ben Omar of the Lamtuna tribe, the Almoravids began unifying southern Amazigh tribes through conquest and religion between 1042-1046 CE. Their first major campaign in Morocco occurred when Sanhaja allies in Sijilmassa requested help against their Zenata rivals, leading to the defeat of the Maghrawa emir and opening the path for northern expansion. Yahya ben Omar, the military commander, died in battle in 1054 CE. His brother, Abu Bakr ben Omar, took command alongside Abdallah ben Yassine, who remained the spiritual leader. Youssef ben Tachfine, Abu Bakr's cousin, emerged as a rising military figure. Abdallah ben Yassine was killed in 1056 CE, but the movement was by then too powerful to stop.

The Almoravids steadily advanced northward, conquering the Souss, Massa, and Taroudant regions. They seized Aghmat, pushed through the Middle Atlas, and finally captured Fez in 1069, marking a major step in unifying Morocco under Almoravid rule. In 1070-1071 CE, Abu Bakr ben Omar left central Morocco to resolve tribal disputes in the Sahara. Before departing, he divorced his wife, Zaynab al-Nafzawiyya, and arranged her marriage to Youssef ben Tachfine. In Abu Bakr’s absence, Youssef rose in prominence and founded **Marrakech**, establishing it as the new Almoravid capital.

Between 1072-1077 CE, Youssef ben Tachfine accused the *taifa* emirs of decadence and gradually deposed them, unifying Muslim Spain under Almoravid rule. He reorganized the administration into four provinces, ruling a vast empire stretching from the gold-rich lands of the Sudan to the Tagus River in central Iberia. The two cousins, Abu Bakr and Youssef, reconciled and continued the unification of Morocco. Abu Bakr conquered the Kingdom of Ghana, spreading Islam into sub-Saharan West Africa, while Youssef consolidated political and religious unity in Morocco under Sunni Islam and the Maliki school of thought.

In 1086 CE, at the urging of Muslim *taifa* rulers from al-Andalus, Youssef ben Tachfine intervened against Alfonso VI of Castile's advance in Iberia. Reinforced by Andalusian troops, he defeated the Christian forces at the Battle of Sagrajas (Zallaqa), temporarily saving Muslim Spain. The Almoravid conquest of Morocco intensified between 1077-1083 CE as they expanded eastward and northward, capturing Tangier, Tlemcen, Oujda, Ténès, Algiers, and Ceuta, securing a key launch point across the Strait of Gibraltar. Youssef ben Tachfine brought nearly all of Muslim Iberia under Almoravid control, uniting a vast empire from Senegal to Algiers and across the Strait into al-Andalus.

After the death of his heir, Youssef ben Tachfine delegated significant authority to the *fuqaha* (Maliki jurists). These jurists came to dominate state affairs and financial administration, gradually overshadowing provincial governors and the military elite, which contributed to administrative stagnation and decline.

A new challenger, **Ibn Tumart**, the spiritual founder of the future Almohad movement, began denouncing Almoravid rule from his base in Tinmal around 1120 CE. He accused the Almoravids of religious corruption, decadence, and moral laxity, causing the dynasty to lose credibility as the Almohads steadily gained followers. In 1129 CE, Almoravid ruler Ali ben Youssef (Youssef ben Tachfine's son) raised taxes to fund ongoing war efforts, sparking widespread discontent. He died in 1143 CE, leaving behind a weakened state.

Clashes broke out between the Almoravids and the rising Almohads, led by Ibn Tumart’s disciple, Abd al-Moumen. The Almohads continued their advance, pursuing and killing Tachfine ben Ali (Ali ben Youssef's son) in 1145 CE. They seized Oujda, Meknès, and Fez. Ceuta and Salé also surrendered that same year, marking the collapse of Almoravid control in northern Morocco. In al-Andalus, Muslim leaders increasingly shifted their allegiance to Abd al-Moumen in 1146 CE as Almoravid authority crumbled. The entire south of Iberia fell under Almohad control, and the Almoravids lost all remaining claim to legitimacy. Led by Abd al-Moumen, the Almohads defeated the Almoravids and captured Marrakech in March 1147 CE, executing all remaining Almoravid princes and establishing Marrakech as their new capital. This marked the official beginning of the Almohad Caliphate.

### **Almohads (1147-1269)**

The Almohads began as a religious movement in the High Atlas during the early 12th century, challenging both the spiritual authority and political power of the Almoravids. Rooted in the Masmuda tribal world and guided by a powerful religious mission, they grew steadily from their base in Tinmel. Ben Tumart, the movement’s founder and self-declared "Mahdi" (religious guide), laid the religious and political foundations of the new order between 1124-1132 CE but died shortly after the Battle of Al Buhayra. After two years of consolidation, his chosen successor, **Abd Al Moumen**, was officially proclaimed caliph.

Abd Al Moumen captured Marrakech in 1147 CE, ending Almoravid rule for good, and assumed the dual role of Imam and Caliph, uniting religious and political authority. In 1148 CE, a major rebellion broke out in the Massa region, led by Ben Houd Al Massi, which was brutally suppressed. Launching a major campaign, Abd Al Moumen captured Tunis, Sfax, and Tripoli in 1159 CE. For the first time, the entire Maghreb (as it is known today) was unified under a single Amazigh Islamic authority. Abd Al Moumen crossed the Strait of Gibraltar in 1160 CE, fortified key points, and defeated Castilian forces near Badajoz, marking a new phase of confrontation with the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula. He died in Salé in 1163 CE while preparing a major campaign into Iberia, leaving behind a vast empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to Libya, the most extensive Amazigh Islamic empire in North African history.

Abd Al Moumen's son, **Abou Yacoub Youssef**, succeeded him in 1163 CE. Initially unpopular, the new caliph gradually earned respect through his piety, devotion to books, and unwavering commitment to Almohad doctrine. Seville became the Almohad capital of al-Andalus between 1170-1172 CE, treated as a political and cultural jewel. Abou Yacoub Youssef spent much of his time there, importing Andalusian craftsmen and commissioning major construction projects in Morocco, including mosques, libraries, and palaces. In 1184 CE, Abou Yacoub Youssef launched a campaign to capture Santarém from the Portuguese but was wounded by a crossbow bolt and died from his injuries in battle.

His successor, **Yacoub Al Mansour** ("the Victorious"), took power in 1184 CE and quickly consolidated control by reforming tax policies and boosting agricultural production. Unlike his predecessor, he invested more in Marrakech than Iberia. In one of the greatest Muslim victories in Iberian history, the Almohads crushed King Alfonso VIII of Castile at the **Battle of Alarcos** on July 19, 1195 CE. This triumph marked the peak of their political and military power and established absolute dominance over Córdoba, Seville, Murcia, Granada, and much of the Guadalquivir Valley. Despite his physical prime, Yacoub Al Mansour died suddenly near Marrakech in 1199 CE. At the time of his death, he was actively investing in monumental construction projects, including the Giralda minaret in Seville, the Kasbah of Marrakech, and the Hassan Tower in Rabat. His unexpected passing marked the beginning of political instability within the Almohad Caliphate.

**Mohammed Al Nasir** ascended the throne in 1199 CE at just 17 years old but lacked the military skill and charisma of his predecessors. He faced a devastating defeat on July 16, 1212 CE, when a massive Christian coalition crushed the Almohad army at the **Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa**. This marked a turning point, as the loss of prestige and territory reopened the path for the Christian reconquest of al-Andalus. Al Nasir narrowly escaped but, in his final years, withdrew into his palace in Marrakech, abandoning governance. He died in 1213 CE, either from brain inflammation or possibly poisoned by his ministers. With his son, Youssef al-Mountassir, only 10 years old, the empire quickly descended into internal clan rivalries and political fragmentation.

A series of short-lived and increasingly weak rulers followed between 1213-1248 CE, often relying on Christian allies to wage internal conflicts. What began as an internal power struggle after Abdallah Al Adil's death in 1224 CE escalated into a full-blown civil war, deeply affecting the population. As the Almohad state weakened, other powers seized the opportunity; remnants of the Almoravids, led by Yahia ben Ghaniya, briefly resurfaced. In North Africa, the Hafsid dynasty in Tunisia declared full independence in 1228 CE, while the Zayanids rose in rebellion in Tlemcen, Algeria. Across the region, local governors ruled like kings, ignoring Marrakech, which became a weakened political center. By 1228 CE, Almohad power in al-Andalus collapsed entirely, ending their presence in Iberia, and Seville fell back into Christian hands in 1248 CE.

**Idris Al Watiq**, the last Almohad sultan, died in Marrakech in 1269 CE as the city fell to a rising Amazigh dynasty of Zenata descent: the Marinids. Since 1245 CE, the Marinids had been strategically isolating Marrakech through gradual territorial strangulation. With their victory, the Almohad era ended, and a new Amazigh chapter began.

### **Marinids (1269-1472)**

The Marinids were a Zenata Amazigh tribe from eastern Morocco, nomadic and warrior-based, who had long moved on the margins of power. They fought alongside the Almohads at the Battle of Alarcos in 1196 CE, but at this stage, they remained subordinate allies. Following the catastrophic Almohad defeat at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 CE, the central authority of the caliphate was severely weakened, and tribes like the Banu Marin began asserting increasing autonomy.

Between 1216-1240 CE, the Marinids advanced into the Rif and Sais plains, asserting their independence more openly. They began extracting tribute from cities like Fès and Taza, signaling the rise of a parallel power center in Morocco focused primarily on economic control and securing tax revenues. Abu Yahya ben Abd Al Haqq captured Meknès in 1245 CE, then led a strategic assault through the Taza Gap to take Fès in 1248 CE, a crucial step toward securing northern Morocco. This marked the Marinids’ true entry into major Moroccan politics. They went on to seize Salé and assert control over the Atlantic plains up to the Oum Rbiaa River. Between 1250 and 1255 CE, the Marinids expanded into Taza, Sijilmassa, and the Draa Valley. After the death of Abou Yahya, his successor, **Abou Youssef Yacoub**, rose to power, emerging as the true architect of Marinid political supremacy.

Despite Hafsid dynasty support, the Marinids failed in their first attempt to capture Marrakech from the Almohads in 1261 CE. Shifting their focus eastward, they defeated the Zayyanids at the Battle of Wadi Tafna in 1268 CE and captured Tlemcen, expanding their influence into western Algeria. Learning from their earlier failure, the Marinids adopted a new strategy: they backed a dissident Almohad prince, Abou Dabbous, who promised them a share of power if he could overthrow his rival, Idris Al Watiq. With Marinid support, Abou Dabbous captured Marrakech, but once in power, he refused to honor the deal. The Marinids swiftly turned against him, defeating his forces in September 1269 CE, and entered Marrakech in triumph, led by Abou Youssef Yacoub, establishing themselves as its new sovereign rulers. The Marinids conducted a purge of the capital, desecrated the tombs of Almohad rulers, and decapitated the bodies of Abd Al Moumen and Yacoub Al Mansour. Abou Youssef Yacoub established a new district in Fès, Fès al-Jadid ("New Fès"), making it the royal and administrative center, distinct from the older quarter, Fès al-Bali.

The Marinid golden age began between 1275-1285 CE. Their forces launched five military expeditions into Spain to support Muslim Granada and assert Marinid power across the Strait. Abou Youssef Yacoub died in 1286 CE and was succeeded by his son, **Abou Yacoub Youssef**. Unlike his father, he retreated from direct ambitions in al-Andalus after losing Cadiz to the Nasrids in 1291 CE. Abou Yacoub Youssef was assassinated in 1307 CE at the siege camp of Mansoura, outside Tlemcen in Algeria.

In 1310 CE, his son **Abou Saïd Othmane II** began a long and mostly internal-focused reign, marked by consolidation rather than expansion. He constructed the Bou Inania Madrasa in Fès, establishing it as a major center of Islamic learning and Maliki scholarship. In 1340 CE, Castilian and Portuguese forces defeated the Marinids at the Battle of Río Salado, ending their ambitions in al-Andalus. From that point on, no Marinid sultan attempted major campaigns in the Iberian Peninsula, though they maintained a limited military presence in outposts.

Sultan **Abou Inan Faris** was assassinated in 1358 CE, triggering court conspiracies, growing instability, and a series of succession wars, with 25 sultans ruling over just 42 years. In 1374 CE, Nasrid Granada captured Gibraltar and Ceuta, definitively ending Marinid military presence in al-Andalus. The reign of **Abou Saïd III** began in 1398 CE amid a period of weakening central authority. Tetouan was captured by Castilian King Henry III a year later, and in 1415 CE, the Portuguese seized Sebta (Ceuta), marking the start of European colonial penetration in Morocco.

After the death of the Marinid sultan, powerful Wattasid vizier Abou Zakariya Yahya installed the young Marinid prince Abd Al Haqq II as a puppet ruler in 1420 CE, marking the beginning of a **Wattasid regency**, rendering the Marinid dynasty largely nominal. Portuguese ambitions escalated; in 1437 CE, their expedition to capture Tangier failed, but their intent remained unchanged. A year later, King Alfonso V launched a more aggressive expansion policy along the Moroccan coast, and the Portuguese captured El Qsar es-Saghir, securing another strategic coastal position. The Revolt of Fès in 1465 CE, led by the Idrisid line (shorfa), saw the people rise up against the corruption and perceived religious weakness of Abd Al Haqq II. He was captured and assassinated, bringing the Marinid dynasty to an end.

### **Wattasids (1472-1554)**

The Wattasids were a Zenata Amazigh clan, closely linked to the Marinids, who originally served as viziers at their court in Fès. In the Revolt of Fès in 1458 CE, Marinid sultan Abd al-Haqq II was executed, but before his death, he ordered the massacre of the main Wattasid leaders. Only the Wattasi Mohammed ash-Cheikh escaped, swearing revenge.

In 1472 CE, **Mohammed ash-Cheikh** seized Fès, becoming the first sovereign of the Banu Wattas and formally establishing the Wattasid dynasty. Although the city lay in ruins and the kingdom was fragmented, he secured the support of the ulama by promising a jihad against the Iberians. That same year, the Portuguese seized Arzila and Tangier, further tightening their grip on the Moroccan coast. Mohammed ash-Cheikh ruled over a land devastated by famine and epidemics, with his authority limited to the north. From Fès, he introduced moderate reforms, arabized his army, and replaced local leaders with loyal scholars. Despite his efforts, he failed to unify the country, which remained fragmented and under constant threat from the Portuguese and rival factions. The Fall of Granada in 1492 CE led to thousands of Andalusian Muslims and Jews fleeing to Morocco, but they were poorly received by both the Wattasid administration and the local population. Attempts at centralization failed, as regions like Chefchaouen, Marrakech, and Debdou remained effectively autonomous.

The reign of **Mohammed al-Burtughali** began in 1505 CE. Raised in Portugal as a hostage, he launched jihad campaigns but failed to alter the balance of power in favor of the Wattasids. Between 1508-1513 CE, the Portuguese seized Safi, followed by Azemmour, tightening their grip on the Atlantic coast and increasing European pressure on the crumbling Wattasid state. A new threat emerged as the **Saadians**, backed by the Jazouli Sufi brotherhoods, rose in the south between 1509-1511 CE. The *chorfas* of the Draa positioned themselves as champions of jihad against both the Portuguese presence and Wattasid inaction. Wattasid attempts to retake Tangier and Asilah between 1511-1515 CE ended in failure. Al-Burtughali signed a truce with the Portuguese, a move widely perceived as weakness and met with disapproval from both the population and the elites.

In 1524 CE, the Saadians captured Marrakech, solidifying their power in the south. That same year, Mohammed al-Burtughali died, and **Ahmed al-Wattasi** ascended to the throne, inheriting a fractured and contested kingdom. Ahmed al-Wattasi suffered defeats against the Saadians at Marrakech (1527 CE) and Animay (1529 CE). He was forced to acknowledge Saadian control over southern Morocco, firmly dividing the kingdom into two rival realms. The Saadians seized Agadir from the Portuguese in 1541 CE, a major symbolic victory that exposed Wattasid weakness and marked a turning point in the struggle for Moroccan leadership. The Wattasids were defeated at Oued el Abid in 1537 CE, losing control of Tadla and Tafilalet, further shrinking their domain. The kingdom was formally divided along the Tadla / Oum er-Rbiaa line, creating a clear boundary between Wattasid and Saadian control.

In 1545 CE, Sultan Ahmed al-Wattasi considered an alliance with the Portuguese but was captured by the Saadians and taken to Marrakech. He was later released in exchange for ceding the regions of Habt, Gharb, and Meknès. Saadian leader Mohammed ash-Cheikh entered Fès in 1549 CE, capturing the Wattasid sultan for a second time. He then departed with his court for Marrakech. In Fès, this event was seen as a national tragedy. Ahmed al-Wattasi's brother, Bou Hassoun, fled to Badis, seeking support from both the Turks of Algiers and the Spanish in a final attempt to reclaim his throne. Under pressure from Saadian forces, the Portuguese evacuated El-Ksar es-Seghir and Asilah in 1550 CE, marking the decline of the Iberian presence along the Moroccan coast, with only Tangier, Mazagan, and Ceuta remaining under their control.

With support from the Turks of Algiers, Bou Hassoun retook Fez in January 1554 CE. However, his restored rule collapsed quickly when Turkish admiral and corsair Salah Rais attempted to place the city under Ottoman control, sparking resistance. On September 13, 1554 CE, Bou Hassoun was killed in an ambush set by the Saadian sharif Mohammed ech-Cheikh at Ras al-Ma’ in the Tadla region. This marked the definitive end of the Wattasid dynasty.

### **Saadians (1510-1660)**

In the early 16th century, Morocco was fractured and threatened by foreign occupations. From the southern region of the Souss, a Sharifian family emerged, claiming descent from the Prophet (pbuh): the Saadians. United by religious legitimacy and their call for jihad against the Portuguese, they rose rapidly, establishing control over the country by facing the Wattasids, and founded a dynasty that would reshape Morocco’s power, culture, and place in the world.

The Saadian family, *chorfas* from the Draa, supported by the influential Sufi order of al-Jazouli, began rallying tribes for a jihad against the Portuguese occupying Atlantic coastal cities. **Mohammed al-Qaym bi-Amr Al lah**, their first recognized leader, received the *bay’a* (oath of loyalty) in Tidsi (Sous) between 1509-1511 CE. Saadian forces successfully launched attacks on Portuguese-controlled outposts like Agadir, Tafedna, and Agouz in 1513 CE, asserting their military strength and religious mission, which enhanced their appeal as a charismatic, nationalist, and spiritual alternative to the fragmented Wattasid authority. Mohammed al-Qaym died in battle during this period.

**Ahmad al-Araj**, a key Saadian leader, seized Marrakech between 1517-1524 CE, establishing it as a base of operations and expanding his control through central and southern Morocco. Meanwhile, his brother **Mohammed ach-Cheikh** governed the Sous, consolidating Saadian influence regionally. The provinces of Tadla and Anmay marked the de facto frontier between the Saadian-controlled south and the Wattassid-controlled north. Mohammed ash-Cheikh scored a major symbolic and strategic victory by recapturing Agadir from the Portuguese in 1541 CE. This blow to Portuguese ambitions strengthened the Saadian image as defenders of Islam and liberators of Morocco, while Ahmad al-Araj began to be sidelined. Tensions rose between the two brothers, culminating in Mohammed ash-Cheikh defeating Ahmad al-Araj in 1544 CE, emerging as the sole ruler. Marrakech became the undisputed capital of the rising Saadian state.

With military superiority and religious legitimacy, the Saadians entered Fez in 1549 CE, effectively collapsing the Wattasid dynasty. Mohammed ash-Cheikh became Sultan of a reunified Morocco. Fortresses like Kasbah Bu Jlud, Kasbah Tamdert, Borj Nord, and Borj Sud solidified Saadian control in the north. Wattassid puppet ruler Bou Hassoun, backed by Ottoman Algeria, momentarily retook Fez in 1554 CE. However, Mohammed ach-Cheikh swiftly returned and defeated him, consolidating Saadian rule and definitively ending Wattassid power.

In 1557 CE, **Mohammed ash-Cheikh** was assassinated by Ottoman agents, in retaliation for his independence from the Ottomans, marking the beginning of a turbulent transition. His son, **Abdal lah al-Ghalib**, succeeded him, repelled Ottoman designs on Morocco, and initiated diplomatic maneuvers with Spain. Under Abdal lah al-Ghalib, the cities of Chefchaouen, Tetouan, and Debdou were brought under Saadian control between 1567-1574 CE. Fortresses were built or refurbished, and military and administrative networks were established across the Gharb and Habt regions.

After Abdal lah al-Ghalib's death in 1574 CE, the kingdom plunged into civil conflict between his son, Al Moutawakkil, and his nephews. These rival parties became the three protagonists of the **Battle of the Three Kings**. In 1578 CE, a Christian-Muslim battle near Ksar el-Kebir (Oued al-Makhazin) altered Morocco’s fate. King Sebastian of Portugal, Saadian Sultan Al Moutawakkil, and his uncle Abd al Malik were all killed. **Ahmad al-Mansour** ("the Golden one") ascended to the throne, inheriting an emboldened and wealthy kingdom following the Portuguese defeat. To better govern, Ahmad al-Mansour divided Morocco into eight viceroyalties in 1585 CE, ensuring control over key regions like the Rif, Tafilalet, and Draa Valley, which were crucial for trans-Saharan trade and military defense.

Ahmad Al Mansour exploited Anglo-Spanish rivalry to secure military and diplomatic gains. He negotiated with Queen Elizabeth I while maintaining ties with Catholic Spain and successfully captured Arzila. He ruled with opulence from Marrakech, building the magnificent El Badi Palace with materials imported from Italy and India. Trade flourished through the control of trans-Saharan routes, and gold from the conquest of the Songhai Empire filled state coffers. Led by Judar Pasha, Moroccan troops crossed the Sahara and defeated the Songhai Empire at Tondibi between 1590-1591 CE. This conquest brought wealth, salt, slaves, and gold, expanding Moroccan sovereignty over Timbuktu, Gao, and other major centers of Saharan trade, though this control proved tenuous and unsustainable in the long term.

Ahmad Al Mansour died in 1603 CE. His sons—al-Mamoun in Fez, Abu Faris in Sous, and Zidan in Marrakech—inherited fragments of the kingdom, leading to a civil war. Abu Faris died of illness in 1610 CE, but the conflict continued, with each prince carving out a domain, supported by European or Turkish allies, further alienating the population. The once-unified *Makhzen* fragmented into rival military camps, disrupting trade routes, and ports like Salé and Rabat became semi-autonomous under corsair control. The Spanish took Larache in 1610 CE after a deal with al-Mamoun. Zidan managed to hold Marrakesh between 1613-1628 CE but failed to fully restore Saadian authority, facing challenges from regional marabouts and foreign interference. He retained an important library, the "Zaydani Collection," now preserved in El Escorial. Al-Mamoun's betrayal of religious principles led to his downfall and assassination, and Fez rejected his rule. The *Makhzen* collapsed in the north as tribal rebellions and *zawiya* influence spread.

A series of short-lived and often weak rulers—al-Walid, Mohammed es-Saghir, and Ahmad al-Abbas—marked the final stage of Saadian decline between 1631-1654 CE. Local warlords and religious brotherhoods increasingly asserted autonomy, particularly in the Atlas and Draa Valley. The assassination of the last Saadian sultan by his own guards in 1659 CE marked the definitive collapse of the dynasty. Morocco entered a period of anarchy, dominated by maraboutic power and local warlords, until the rise of the Alaoui clan shortly after.

The *Histoire du Maroc* (History of Morocco), edited by Mohamed Kably, is a thoughtfully crafted work of considerable dimensions, featuring beautifully produced maps and illustrations. It was published by Édition de l’Institut royal pour la recherche sur l’histoire du Maroc in 2011, with a revised edition in 2012, and has been translated into English as *History of Morocco: A Work of Synthesis and Update*. Significant extracts from the English translation are available on the Royal Institute for Research in the History of Morocco's website. This volume is seen as a landmark work of interest to historians across various fields and does not render obsolete earlier scholarly works like Jean Brignon's *Histoire du Maroc* (1967), to which Kably and his collaborators often refer.

Two years after the main volume, a complementary work titled *Chronologie de l’histoire du Maroc. Des temps préhistoriques à la fin du XXe siècle* was published, also edited by Mohamed Kably. Kably's introduction to this chronology reflects on the notion of "event" and its polysemic nature, while Abderrahmane El Moudden offers insights into chronological criteria, the duality of Hegiran and Christian calendars, and source peculiarities. This reasoned chronology also serves as a comprehensive index with its own commentary and annexes, confirming the vision of an overall project.

The *Histoire du Maroc* is a collective effort involving over fifty authors, mostly Moroccan, reflecting a process of **"Moroccanization"** within the discipline of history. While the specific roles of individual authors are not always identified, the contributions from various specialists in their respective fields of specialization are evident, leading to differences in style and expression across chapters. The work attempts to combine the unity of a research project with the remarkable diversity of its inputs, guided by shared references and questions.

The primary guiding principle of the *Histoire du Maroc* is **chronological**, spanning from prehistoric times up to "Independent Morocco," with chapters organized along a unified temporal axis. The book avoids a ritualistic "land and its people" presentation, instead emphasizing the succession of phases. It directly confronts questions of **periodization**, acknowledging that definitions like the late antique Maghreb (3rd-7th century CE) have been influenced by 19th-century French historians. The authors, while sometimes expressing reservations, largely adhere to classic European historical divisions like the "Middle Ages," influenced by French educational traditions during the Protectorate. The Moroccan 15th century, for example, is presented as a "transitory period" between the Middle Ages and the "modern" age, starting with the Portuguese occupation of Ceuta in 1415 and ending with the foundation of the Saadian dynasty in 1510\. Similarly, the "long nineteenth century" (1790-1912) is evoked, with 1790 chosen as a starting point due to its announcement of "irreversible" European influence on Morocco.

The work begins with a unique first chapter by geographer Mohamed Naciri, titled "Natural Dynamics and their Influence on Territorial Structuring in Morocco". This prologue rejects geographical determinism and highlights the interplay of internal (territorial configuration) and external (geopolitical position) constraints, alongside ethnic and "maraboutic-Sharifian" logics. It interweaves geographical, historical, ecological, religious, cultural, and state-related threads, organizing Morocco into four complex groupings: the Sahara, the Atlas mountains, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean. This chapter establishes the "historicity" of space as a dynamic introduction to the subsequent historical narratives.

At its core, the *Histoire du Maroc* is a **state-centered history**, primarily concerned with the *makhzen* (state) as the origin and locus of central power. It describes and analyzes developments in relation to the *makhzen*, whether dominant or weakened, and its role in power struggles and against territorial fragmentation. This emphasis is seen in discussions of the Almoravid and Almohad periods, the sultanates of Moulay Ismail and Moulay Hassan, the Merinid sultans' patronage of arts, and the construction of the Alawite *makhzen*. While the book addresses aspects like Saadian art and architecture, these are sometimes presented in a framed layout, implying a potential difficulty in integrating them fully into the power-focused narrative.

The book extends to the **"very longue durée,"** incorporating two long phases on Morocco's pre-Islamic history (up to the 8th century BCE) and its relationship with the Mediterranean world before Islam. It addresses the challenges of reconstructing this past due to limited sources and touches upon significant figures like Juba II, presented as a complex figure who influenced early Romanization and urban development. The authors' approach to Juba II is detailed and conscientious, avoiding hyperbole.

The *Histoire du Maroc* consistently defends the idea of Morocco as **multiple and pluralistic**. This plurality is evident in its discussions of local histories, such as the quasi-independent city-states of Ceuta, Safi, Tetouan, Rabat, and Salé, the latter thriving on maritime corsairing. The work also highlights **social and demographic diversity**, including the Arab, Berber, and Jewish components of the population. It discusses the history of Jews in Morocco, emphasizing periods of convergence and symbiosis alongside tensions, with figures like Haïm Zafrani underscoring a dual identity rooted in universal Judaism and local culture. The book also examines the presence of **sub-Saharan African populations** in Morocco, particularly in the context of the *'Abid al-Bukhari* army under Moulay Ismail. It clarifies that this army was primarily recruited within Morocco itself, challenging notions of massive slave convoys from Sudan solely for sugar plantations. The complex and heterogeneous nature of these military forces, defying simple racial or legal distinctions, is underscored.

Furthermore, the book explores Morocco's **external relations and the internationalization of knowledge**. It describes exchanges with the outside world through gateways like coastal cities and Gibraltar, and the introduction of goods like tea and porcelain through European trade and diplomatic missions. Accounts from European captives, such as Germain Moüette, provide an "Other's gaze" into Moroccan society and cultural interactions, including theological debates and the circulation of knowledge. The book also touches upon the contribution of foreign scholars and explorers to the study of Morocco, acknowledging how political contexts and ideologies may have influenced their work, yet recognizing their role as eye-witnesses who shaped disciplines.

In conclusion, the *Histoire du Maroc* is presented as an undeniable achievement, characterized by its erudition, unity, and accessible, pedagogical approach. It is a scholarly work grounded in up-to-date, diverse historical knowledge, acknowledging both recent research and valuable "classic" studies. The book's strength lies in its ability to adapt to a variety of subjects within a unified framework, demonstrating an "experimental and pragmatic" approach to Moroccan historiography.

The article "Warfare and Firearms in Fifteenth Century Morocco, 1400-1492" by Weston F. Cook Jr. examines the role of firepower warfare in Morocco during a period of significant political, social, and commercial change in the broader Afro-Asian and Iberian world. While Europe experienced an "Early Modern Military Revolution" rooted in the "Gunpowder Revolution" of the fifteenth century, Morocco was on the verge of political extinction. The article's ambition is modest, focusing on Morocco and offering tentative conclusions rather than declarative ones.

Morocco's primary foreign antagonist, Portugal, utilized a powerful combination of amphibious assault, naval suppressive fire, and a divide-and-conquer strategy, all heavily reliant on artillery warfare and the arquebuse. Lisbon established fortified coastal enclaves and supported them with a self-sufficient seaborne logistical network, using a "carrot-and-stick" approach of commercial incentives for compliant Moroccan notables and violent military excursions into the countryside. These incursions, along with Castilian aggression, accelerated the fragmentation of the Banu Marin sultanate (1262-1465) and led to the rise of the Banu Wattas (1465-1554). However, the new Wattasid Sultanate, which gained stability in 1472 after 15 years of civil turmoil, was more disjointed than its predecessor due to foreign pressures and a "populist gunpowder revolution aborning within society itself".

The analysis of the "Gunpowder Revolution" in Morocco is complicated by sparse and poorly reconstructed indigenous records, with many scholars showing distaste for the era. Consequently, much of the information relies on the often-triumphalist writings of Portuguese chroniclers, some Castilians, and a Lowlands cavalier, Jurge Von Ehingen. These sources, despite their biases, repeatedly testify to the vital role of artillery and firearms in Portuguese hegemony.

Portugal's assault began in 1415 with the capture of Sabta (Ceuta), where the installation of *bombardas*, *colebratas*, and *falconetes* proved crucial for its defense against Moroccan counter-sieges. Although hand-held guns (*tiros de fogo*) and riflemen (*espingarieros*) appeared in Morocco with King Duarte's 1437 expedition against Tangiers, they did not prevent a humiliating Portuguese defeat. Despite this, Lisbon continued to raid coastal villages and induce harbor towns like Tangiers, Sla, Safi, Azammur, Anfa, and Massa to abandon their allegiance to the Banu Marin dynasty. In 1458, King Affonso seized Qsar-s-Saghir, where Lisbon's ship-to-shore fire effectively repelled Muslim defenders, and artillery was decisive in its capture and defense. The first confirmed gunpowder artillery weapon in Moroccan hands was a bombard found as loot in Ceuta in 1415\.

Moroccans soon acquired and used artillery. In 1419, Sultan Abu Sa'id led an international Muslim expedition against Ceuta, which included two bombards crewed by Granadan advisors. Although the assault was ultimately unsuccessful, it demonstrated Moroccan access to European military technology through Granadan Muslims. However, questions remain about the organization, support, and origin of these early Moroccan gun batteries. The 1437 contest for Tangiers saw Portuguese infantry deploying formations of "handgunners and crossbowmen," but personal firearms had yet to appear in Moroccan ranks. In this conflict, the Portuguese lost several weapons, including guns, which were subsequently used in *makhzan* service.

In 1456-57, Moroccan forces demonstrated increased proficiency, coordinating artillery fire with ground attacks during a massive assault on Ceuta and employing harassing fire to prevent sorties. When Affonso seized Qsar-s-Saghir the following year, the Moroccan Wazir led a counter-siege with at least 32 guns, and Moroccan soldiers armed with hand-guns were noted for the first time. During this unsuccessful eight-week siege, Moroccan batteries used pairs of bombards, often firing them in alternating sequence or volley, and employed dummy guns and multiple positions. The presence of Granadan, Moroccan, and "elchees" (European mercenaries, prisoners, and converts) as crewmen confirmed that the Banu Marin *makhzan* now possessed a distinct, full-time artillery corps. Zurara, a Portuguese chronicler, reported that Banu Marin batteries fired over 30 rounds a day, a respectable volume of fire, though he claimed they inflicted little damage despite firing 1,595 cannonballs. The failure of these sieges was attributed to the defenders' natural advantages, superior Portuguese artillery, continuous resupply, and increasingly, internal conflict within the Moroccan state.

For the next decade, Portuguese raids and cannonades against the coast became almost annual events, leading to the destruction of cities like Anfa (modern Casablanca) in 1463\. Conversely, Moroccan artillery almost vanishes from records during the 1460s, a period marked by Marinid-Wattasid wars and a lack of documentation. By 1471, Portugal's King Affonso launched an unprecedented armada against Arzila, overwhelming the defenders with 400 ships, over 30,000 troops, and a landing force armed with arquebuses, crossbows, and cannons. This led to the surrender of Arzila and Tangiers, and Muhammad ash-Shaykh al-Wattas, facing superior Portuguese firepower, signed a humiliating ten-year truce.

Over 15 years, the balance of firepower drastically shifted in Portugal's favor, attributed to Affonso's decision to "modernize" his arsenal with German and Flemish artisans to cast bronze cannons and forge matchlock arquebuses. Lisbon also established trading posts in quasi-autonomous port towns, which were then fortified with cannons and garrisons, and enforced a strict arms embargo to prevent the sale of gunpowder weapons to Muslims. This vigilance likely accelerated the depletion of Moroccan gunpowder arsenals. European observers nearing the sixteenth century often remarked on the absence of firearms among Moroccans and their apparent ignorance and terror of gunnery. Moroccan chroniclers also alluded to their own lack of firepower, either by omission or by commenting on the "irresistibility" of cannons.

Despite this period of decline, glimpses of Moroccan gunpowder weapons in action reappeared in the 1490s. Leo Africanus mentioned that the Wattasid Sultan installed 100 *makhzan* arquebusiers at Larache after the abortive "Fort Graciosa" campaign, and credited the skillful deployment of arquebuse soldiers for the success of *makhzan* tactics against cavalry militias at Dubdu in 1496\. More significantly, Africanus noted the proliferation of firearms, including the arquebuse and *espingard*, among tribes and polities in the Dra'a valley in Morocco's deep south, who resisted both Portuguese and Wattasid control. This incipient revival of firearms capabilities suggests that gunpowder weaponry would soon revolutionize communal defiance and resistance in Morocco, marking the beginning of the country's "military revolution" in the sixteenth century.

A key factor in the fluctuation of Moroccan gunnery was the complex relationship with Granada, the last Islamic state in Iberia. Until the late 1450s, Granada was a primary source for weapons, expertise, and crews for Morocco. However, there is no evidence that the Marinids or Muhammad ash-Shaykh al-Wattas attempted to establish domestic production of firearms, with Morocco's first foundry not appearing until the 1530s. After 1458, these ties unraveled due to internal political strife in both states and intensified military isolation caused by Portuguese surveillance. During the Granadan War (1481-1492), Muhammad ash-Shaykh al-Wattas maintained an "embarrassed neutrality," selling grain to Christians and observing the Castilian blockade. When Granada fell in 1492, a significant number of Granadan war veterans, experienced in gunpowder combat or crafts, migrated to Morocco, finding service with the *makhzan*, as privateers, bodyguards, mercenaries, and even with domestic challengers to the Wattasids. The fifteenth century, therefore, laid the dim and debatable roots for Morocco's prolonged military revolution in the sixteenth century, highlighting the necessity of studying military history as social and international comparative history.

The mid-16th century in Morocco was a pivotal period marked by the intense conflict between the declining **Wattasid dynasty** and the ascendant **Saadian sharifs**. This struggle was not merely for territory but represented a clash of legitimacy, governance models, and the very identity of the emergent Moroccan state. The conflict unfolded on a complex geopolitical stage, with the formidable powers of the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain) and the Ottoman Empire casting long shadows over the Maghreb, influencing alliances and shaping Morocco's identity.

### **The Decline of Wattasid Power**

By the early 16th century, the Wattasid dynasty, of Zenata Berber origin, was in terminal decline. Formally established in Fez in 1472 as successors to the Marinids, their authority was tenuous and largely confined to northern Morocco. The south had fragmented into principalities, and vital Atlantic ports were increasingly falling under Portuguese control. The Wattasids' legitimacy, initially secured through alliances with the urban elite of Fez and Idrisid sharifian families, became fragile due to a crisis of confidence among the populace. They were widely perceived as having failed in their sacred duty to defend the *dar al-Islam* (abode of Islam) against Christian encroachments, adopting a policy of conciliation towards the aggressively expanding Portuguese and Spanish. This strategic failure had devastating economic consequences, as Portuguese occupation of key commercial hubs like Safi, Mazagan, Agadir, and Mogador severed Morocco's traditional trans-Saharan and maritime trade routes, leading to economic stagnation and social unrest. This military impotence and economic decay created a power vacuum, particularly in the south, fostering an environment ripe for new leadership.

### **The Rise of the Saadian Sharifs**

Emerging from the Sous Valley in the south, the Saadian family posed a potent challenge to the Wattasids, building their claim on military success and superior religious legitimacy. They asserted *sharifian* lineage, claiming direct descent from the Prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatima and grandson Hasan ibn Ali, which was a powerful ideological tool resonating deeply in a society seeking spiritual and political renewal. This marked a significant shift from centuries of Berber-led dynasties, establishing a model of political legitimacy vested in the Prophet's house that would endure in Morocco.

The Saadians translated this religious charisma into political power through a relentless and successful *jihad* against the Portuguese. Their rise began with the unification of tribes in the Sous Valley, culminating in the watershed moment of their capture of the Portuguese stronghold of Agadir in 1541\. This immense military and propaganda triumph cemented their status as heroes and true defenders of the faith, galvanizing popular support and allowing them to systematically roll back the Portuguese presence, taking control of other key ports like Azemmour and Safi. The conflict escalated, with open rivalry declared in 1528, following the 1527 Treaty of Tadla that partitioned Morocco. The Saadians used their southern base to capture Marrakesh in 1524, decisively defeat the Wattasid army at the Battle of Wadi al-'Abid in 1536, and finally conquer the Wattasid capital of Fez in 1549\. The last Wattasid ruler, Ali Abu Hassun, was defeated and killed at the Battle of Tadla in September 1554, making the Saadian sultan, Muhammad al-Shaykh, the undisputed master of a reunified Morocco.

### **The Ottoman-Portuguese-Moroccan Geopolitical Triangle**

The Wattasid-Saadian conflict was deeply entwined with the wider strategic competition between the Ottoman Empire and Habsburg Spain (allied with Portugal). Morocco's strategic location made it a prize, and its internal struggle provided an entry point for imperial ambitions. In a desperate move, Wattasid ruler Abu Hassun declared himself an Ottoman vassal in 1545 and sought aid. The Ottomans, aiming to extend influence across North Africa, provided limited support, enabling Abu Hassun to briefly retake Fez in January 1554 with Algerian troops under Salah Reis. However, the Saadians reconquered the city months later, ending Wattasid rule permanently.

The Saadian victory recast external pressures, as a strong, unified, and expansionist Morocco now positioned itself as a significant third force, a buffer state between the two superpowers. Saadian Sultan Muhammad al-Shaykh refused vassalage, directly challenging the Ottoman Sultan's claim to Muslim leadership by proclaiming himself Caliph and Mahdi. This assertion of supreme authority was anathema to the Ottomans, leading to the assassination of Muhammad al-Shaykh in 1557 by an Ottoman agent. The Saadians, in turn, pursued complex diplomacy, cultivating commercial and political contacts with European powers like England and France to counterbalance Spanish and Ottoman influence, thereby forging a distinct Moroccan state identity adept at navigating early modern global politics.

### **The Armies of the Sultanates: A Comparative Analysis**

The outcome of the Wattasid-Saadian conflict was largely determined by the significant technological and organizational differences between their armies. The Saadian military was an early modern war machine built on gunpowder and professional discipline, while the Wattasid host represented a late-medieval army unable to adapt to 16th-century warfare realities.

#### **The Wattasid Host: The Old Guard**

The Wattasid army reflected military traditions of the preceding Marinid era, relying on feudal levies and a small professional core. Its structure comprised:

* **Tribal levies:** Primarily cavalry from allied Zenata Berber tribes, whose loyalty was conditional, dependent on pay and plunder, and often seasonal. Leo Africanus estimated the Wattasid sultan of Fez maintained a permanent force of 6,000 cavalry, including 500 mounted crossbowmen and 500 mounted arquebusiers, likely referring to the elite corps.  
* **Makhzaniyyah:** An elite, salaried standing cavalry corps, continuing the Marinid system, serving as the sultan's personal guard and frontier defenders.  
* **Foreign specialists:** Granadan advisors and European renegades ('*elchees*') were employed to crew artillery pieces.

Wattasid arms, armor, and attire lacked standardization. Visual evidence from the Pastrana Tapestries (depicting the Portuguese conquest of Asilah in 1471\) shows a variety of head protection including turbans, European-style kettle helmets, sallets, and Islamic-style helmets similar to Mamluk designs. Shields were generally round, with the traditional leather *adarga* also common. Weaponry included lances and sabers for cavalry, with elite units using crossbows and early firearms. They possessed siege artillery (large bombards) but were technologically outmatched and logistically inferior to Portuguese forces. Regular battle dress included flowing robes and tunics, with no standardized uniform; rank was indicated by the quality of fabric and ornamentation. Elite troops like the *Makhzaniyyah* received clothing as part of their pay.

#### **The Saadian Force: Architects of a New Way of War**

In contrast, the Saadians were military innovators, consciously creating a new type of army that embraced gunpowder technology and professional organization. Their army underwent rapid evolution, starting as a feudal force but quickly establishing a professional, standing army funded by a new, centralized taxation system (*naiba*). This professional core grew from an initial 500 cavalry to 3,000 by al-Qaim's death, and more than tenfold by 1540\.

Saadian forces featured a diverse recruitment base to ensure loyalty to the state over specific tribes, including allied Berber and Arab tribes, **Andalusi Muslims** (refugees eager for revenge against Iberians), **Turkish officers** (bringing Ottoman tactical expertise), and **European renegades and mercenaries**. Later, Saadian sultans like Ahmad al-Mansur would deliberately entrust high military commands to European and Andalusi officers to limit Turkish influence, also employing them as personal guards.

The decisive factor in Saadian success was their complete adoption of firearms, building their entire military doctrine around them.

* **Arquebusiers:** Formed the core, deployed as infantry skirmishers and mounted units. Mounted arquebusiers were drilled in advanced tactics like the **caracole**, creating continuous volleys of fire.  
* **Artillery:** They assembled a formidable artillery train. The capture of Agadir in 1541 provided access to oceanic trade routes for European arms imports and wealth from the sugar trade to fund a domestic arms industry. A cannon foundry was established in Marrakesh under a skilled Morisco artisan. At Agadir, Muhammad al-Shaykh deployed over 50 cannons, including massive bronze siege guns like *Maïmuna* (firing 420mm stone munitions) which were hauled by camels to high ground for plunging shots, demonstrating sophisticated modern siege craft.

Ottoman influence was significant in Saadian military transformation. Sultan Abd al-Malik (1576-1578) explicitly reorganized his army along Ottoman lines and adopted Ottoman-style clothing for his court and troops as a statement of modernity and power. Saadian elite and professional soldiers likely adopted attire similar to Janissaries, including long coats or kaftans, often made from dark blue English wool ("Brown Blues") for high-ranking officials, which became a signature color of the Saadian elite.

### **Command, Rank, and Distinction**

In both armies, hierarchy blended formal titles with displays of wealth, but the Saadians moved towards a more centralized command.

* **Wattasids:** The Sultan was supreme commander, but field armies could be led by a vizier. The *Makhzaniyyah* were commanded by a *qā'id*. Rank was distinguished by equipment quality, fabric richness, weapon ornamentation, and horse quality.  
* **Saadians:** The Sultan was the absolute commander-in-chief, often appointing his sons to command formations to ensure loyalty. The adoption of Ottoman-style organization suggests formalized officer ranks (e.g., *Agha*, *Bey*). Distinction of rank was primarily visual but more codified, with Ottoman-influenced kaftans creating clearer uniforms for the elite. Luxurious dark blue kaftans of imported English wool identified high-ranking commanders. Sultan Ahmad al-Mansour later formalized this with an elite guard of 2,500 warriors with distinctive dress and equipment.

### **Comparative Military Profile (c. 1554\)**

The Battle of Tadla in 1554 showcased the military asymmetries.

* **Army Composition:** Wattasids relied on Zenata Berber tribal levies and a small *Makhzaniyyah*. Saadians had a growing professional standing army of diverse recruits (loyal tribes, Andalusis, Turks, Europeans) funded by centralized taxes, with tribal levies as auxiliaries.  
* **Primary Armament (Cavalry):** Wattasids used lance and saber, with small elite mounted crossbowmen/arquebusiers. Saadians used lance and saber, widely supplemented by matchlock arquebus, with mounted arquebusiers as a key offensive element.  
* **Primary Armament (Infantry):** Wattasid infantry had limited roles, using spears, swords, shields, and some crossbows. Saadian infantry was a core component, dominated by disciplined arquebusiers deployed as skirmishers.  
* **Artillery:** Wattasids possessed siege artillery but were outmatched in number, quality, and tactical deployment. Saadians had a modern and potent artillery train, many produced domestically, used skillfully in mobile field roles and complex sieges.  
* **Tactical Doctrine:** Wattasids relied on traditional massed cavalry charges and static sieges. Saadians employed innovative combined-arms tactics, integrating infantry firearms, mobile artillery, and cavalry, using advanced maneuvers like the caracole.  
* **Funding Model:** Wattasids relied on a failing feudal model of tribute and dwindling state treasury due to lost coastal trade. Saadians were funded by a modern, centralized tax system (*naiba*) and substantial revenues from conquered ports and the sugar trade. The Saadian success was a self-reinforcing cycle: military victories secured trade routes, which provided resources for advanced gunpowder weapons, leading to further victories and state consolidation.

### **Banners of Power: Flags and Dynastic Identity**

Flags and banners were potent symbols of legitimacy, authority, and military identity.

* **Wattasid Standard:** The precise design is uncertain. A specific design on Vexilla Mundi (white field, thick red border, central black-and-white checkered square with red square) lacks corroboration. A more widely circulated depiction attributes a plain red field with a central gold eight-pointed star (from two overlapping squares) to Wattasids, Marinids, and Saadians, suggesting it was a general state symbol for the Sultanate of Fez. The Marinids' primary color was white, sometimes with religious inscriptions, suggesting the Wattasids might have continued using a white royal standard, while the red flag served as a broader state symbol. Different colored flags were also used for military units.  
* **Saadian Banner:** Evidence points to both red and white banners. The red flag with the gold star is often attributed to them, linking them to Moroccan state tradition and the *shurafa*. However, specific textual evidence confirms the primary personal and royal banner of early Saadian sultans was **white**, known as *al-'alam al-mansûr* ("the Victorious Banner"). This was a sophisticated political act, claiming legitimacy as heirs to the Marinids while revitalizing the tradition under new *sharifian* leadership. Descriptions portray it as a "dramatic statement in white," often silk, embroidered with Qur'anic verses in gold thread. The choice of white, eschewing green, signaled the Saadian movement's unique, divinely favored nature. Historians confirmed its use in royal parades, suggesting a hierarchy where the white *al-'alam al-mansûr* was the Sultan's personal standard, and a red flag a more general state or war banner.  
* **Language of Color on the Battlefield:** In the 16th century, colored banners were essential for command, control, and communication, identifying units, signaling maneuvers, and providing rallying points. Almohad armies used various colored flags, and the Ottoman army, emulated by Saadians, had a developed system of unit flags. Saadians likely adopted similar systems for their professional army, resulting in a colorful spectacle led by the Sultan's white banner, with other colored flags marking formations.

### **The Fabric of Daily Life: Civilian Attire in a Time of Transition**

Civilian attire in mid-16th century Morocco reflected social status, wealth, occupation, and regional identity, with new garments among the elite and traditional dress for common people.

#### **The Urban & Elite Wardrobe**

The Saadian era saw significant developments in elite fashion due to the dynasty's wealth and cosmopolitan connections.

* **Kaftan:** A long, one-piece robe, open at the front, fastened with braided-silk buttons (*aakad*) and trimmed with decorative braid (*sfifa*), likely introduced from Persia or the Ottoman Empire. Initially for men, it was adopted enthusiastically by women during the Saadian period, spurring innovation in luxurious fabrics. Elite men favored kaftans made from dark blue English wool ("Brown Blues"), which signified wealth.  
* **Takchita:** Popularized by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansour, this was an elaborate two-piece women's ensemble with a foundational kaftan (*tahtiya*) worn under an ornate over-tunic (*fouqia* or *mansouria*).  
* **Jabador:** An ensemble of a loose-fitting tunic and baggy trousers (*sarwal*). Originally everyday wear, it became a symbol of elite status for urban notables and high-ranking artisans in the 16th century.  
* **Qamīṣ:** A loose-fitting tunic or shirt, a foundational garment for most urban dwellers.  
* **Sarwal:** Loose, baggy trousers, worn as part of the Jabador or standalone.  
* **Djellaba:** A distinctive, ankle-length hooded robe, the most common outer garment for both men and women. Its material and color could indicate status, with fine white wool associated with aristocracy.

#### **Clothing of the Common Folk (Doukkala Region)**

The Doukkala region, an Atlantic coastal area with a mix of Arab and Berber tribes near Portuguese-controlled Mazagan and Safi, was a fertile agricultural plain and textile center.

* **Haik:** The single most important garment for commoners, a large, versatile piece of woven fabric (approx. 5m x 1.5m) draped to envelop the body from head to toe. Worn by both men and women over underclothes, it provided protection and modesty. Doukkala haiks were famous for quality and a major export, traded widely via trans-Saharan routes. For commoners, it was likely woven from local wool, in plain, undyed, or earth-toned colors.  
* **Basic Underclothing:** Peasants wore a simple *qamīṣ* (tunic) and *sarwal* (trousers) made from durable, locally produced fabrics like rough wool or linen. Dyes from local vegetables resulted in common colors like brown, red, and grey.  
* **Footwear:** Simple and practical, consisting of leather slippers known as **babouches** or sturdy leather clogs for rougher work.

#### **Portuguese Presence and Cultural Exchange**

The Portuguese presence in coastal enclaves was primarily military and commercial, forming alliances with some local tribes. Their influence on local Moroccan clothing was more economic than stylistic, as Moroccans did not adopt 16th-century Portuguese attire due to cultural and climatic differences. Instead, Portuguese demand for local products, especially textiles like the Doukkala haik, stimulated the regional economy and reinforced traditional goods production. While new European cloth may have entered coastal markets, the fundamental forms of Moroccan dress remained unchanged, reflecting a largely one-way exchange where Moroccan crafts were valued exports.

### **Conclusion**

The mid-16th century was a watershed in Moroccan history, transforming the state, its military, and its identity. The Wattasid-Saadian conflict showcased a clear narrative of military evolution: the Wattasids represented a medieval system, unable to keep pace with gunpowder technology and reliant on unreliable tribal loyalties. Their eclectic armor and decentralized command reflected a fragmented state. The Saadians, conversely, built a professional, disciplined army by combining *sharifian* ideology with a robust financial model from centralized taxation and trade. Their embrace of modern firearms, domestic arms industry, and sophisticated tactics gave them a decisive advantage, making their military machine the engine of their political success.

This transformation was mirrored in their material and symbolic culture. The Wattasids represented continuity with Morocco's Berber-led medieval past, likely inheriting banners from Marinid predecessors. The Saadians were conscious architects of a new identity; their adoption of the white, embroidered *al-'alam al-mansûr* was a brilliant act of political communication, claiming ancient legitimacy while signaling a radical and victorious renewal. Their embrace of Ottoman-influenced fashion for elite troops symbolized their ambition and alignment with the most powerful Islamic empire of the day, forging a unique Moroccan synthesis of power. Even the widespread production and export of the traditional *haik* in the Doukkala region reflected a vibrant local economy and deeply rooted culture that persisted amidst conflict. The Wattasid-Saadian conflict was foundational for the modern Moroccan state, establishing the principle of *sharifian* rule, a professional national army, and Morocco's unique position as an independent power, distinct from its European and Ottoman neighbors.

The provided resource details the history and rivalries of three prominent Zenata Berber tribes: the Banū Maghrawa, Banū Miknasa, and Banū Ifrān. These tribes played significant roles in the political landscape of the Maghreb, particularly in Morocco, from the late 8th century until their eventual subjugation by the Almoravids in the 11th century.

### **Banū Maghrawa**

The **Banū Maghrawa** were considered the most powerful branch of the Zenata confederation, based primarily in central Morocco, with their influence extending from Taza to Fez, Tadla, and Sijilmasa. Their key leaders included al-Khazar ibn Hafṣ in the 8th century, Muḥammad ibn Khazar who seized Taza in the 10th century, and **Zīrī ibn ʿAṭiyya** (978–1001), who ruled Fez and much of Morocco. They were predominantly loyal to the **Umayyads of Córdoba**, although they occasionally "flirted" with the Fatimids before returning to their pro-Umayyad stance. The Maghrawa controlled Fez for approximately a century, from around 950 to 1069 CE. Their rule ended when they were crushed by the rising **Almoravids** and absorbed into their empire.

### **Banū Miknasa**

The **Banū Miknasa** were associated with the Middle Atlas region, including Taza and Sijilmasa, and were known for their shifting allegiances. Initially leaning towards **Kharijite Rustamid** ideologies, they later became strong allies of the **Fatimids**, especially in Sijilmāsa and Tripoli. Notable leaders included Abū Qurra (late 8th century), an ally of the Idrissids, and **Masāla ibn Ḥabbūs** (10th century), who served as a Fatimid commander. The Midrar ibn Yīsū of the 8th-9th century was the founder of the Sijilmāsa dynasty, which was held under the Fatimid orbit by the Banū Wāsūl and later the Banū Khazrūn, who expanded eastward to rule Tripoli in the 11th century. The Miknasa ultimately lost control of Morocco to the Maghrawa due to Fatimid decline and were absorbed by the Almoravids in the mid-11th century.

### **Banū Ifrān**

The **Banū Ifrān** were based in Middle Morocco, specifically from Taza to Salé, and were characterized as **militant Kharijites**. Their leaders included Abū Qurra Yafranī (8th century), an early Kharijite emir, and Yaddū ibn Yaʿlā (9th century), who fought the Idrissids. A significant figure was **Abū Yazīd “al-Ḥimar”** (d. 947), who led a major Kharijite revolt in Ifriqiya with Ifrān support. In the 11th century, Yaʿlā ibn Abī Bakr was an anti-Umayyad rebel based in Salé. The Banū Ifrān were strongly Kharijite (Ibāḍī/Ṣufrī) and often opposed both the Fatimids and Umayyads. Centered on Salé, they frequently fought against the Maghrawa and Umayyads. Their power was eventually crushed by the **Almoravids** between 1050 and 1060 CE.

### **Conclusion**

In summary, the Maghrawa functioned as the de facto "kings" of Morocco, ruling Fez as allies of the Umayyads; the Miknasa acted as "bureaucrats/mercenaries," particularly with the Sijilmāsa bankers as clients of the Fatimids; and the Banū Ifrān were "rebels," known for their hardcore Kharijite beliefs and perpetual insurgency. All three Zenata tribes ultimately fell to the **Almoravids in the 11th century**, who unified Morocco under Maliki Sunni Islam, bringing an end to their independent rule.

Morocco's linguistic landscape is characterized by the complex interaction of four primary languages: **Classical Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, Berber, and French**. This interplay is profoundly shaped by religion, ethnicity, and issues of identity, education, and development. The historical evolution of this situation over fourteen centuries is crucial for understanding current debates about language policy. Issues of language and identity frequently arise when multiple languages compete for cultural, political, educational, or economic space. The adoption of one language as official can confer legitimacy and prestige, potentially leading to feelings of exclusion and marginalization among speakers of other languages tied to their identity. The situation in the Maghreb (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia) is distinct from the Middle East and Gulf regions due to different ethnic and linguistic make-up, and particularly its history as a French colony, which significantly altered the linguistic balance.

In contemporary Morocco, each of the four main languages occupies a distinct, sometimes contentious, space:

* **Classical Arabic** is a written language, primarily used in formal education, media, administration, and religion. It is the official language and dominant in written literary forms. It is not anyone's native language but is learned through formal instruction. Islam confers a privileged position to Classical Arabic as the language of the Qur'an and prayers.  
* **Moroccan Arabic** is the native language for the majority of the population. It is the language of popular culture, including works of literature, TV, cinema, and newspapers. While sharing properties with Classical Arabic, there are significant differences at lexical, phonological, morphological, and syntactic levels.  
* **Berber** is the language of the original people of Morocco and the native language of an estimated 40% of the population. Despite being the language of a vibrant culture, it is not recognized as an official language.  
* **French** is not an official language but holds dominance in higher education, particularly in the sciences, certain media sectors, and industries like banking. It also has a presence in cultural activities through Francophone literature.

The historical roots of this linguistic situation trace back to the **Arab conquest in the second half of the 7th century**. Before this, Berber, an Afroasiatic language, was prevalent across a wide swathe of North Africa. The Arabs introduced Islam and Arabic, and the conversion of Berbers was swift, even leading to a Berber-led military force invading Spain and establishing a Muslim state where Arabic became the language of scholarship for Arab, Berber, and Jewish scholars. Early Moroccan dynasties like the Almoravids, Almohads, and Marinids were Berber, while subsequent dynasties identified as Arab. The Arabs brought two varieties of Arabic: Classical Arabic, the religious language of Islam, and colloquial Arabic. **Diglossia**, the coexistence of two varieties of the same language family with separate roles and prestige, has characterized Arabic-speaking societies from early Islamic centuries. The Arabization of the Maghreb intensified with waves of immigration from the East, particularly the Banu Hilal and Banu Maaqil in the 12th century, and more significantly, an influx of Arabic-speaking Muslims from southern Spain (Andalusia) after the end of Arab-Muslim rule there in the late 15th century due to the Spanish Inquisition. While major cities gained sizable Arab populations, much of the countryside, especially mountainous and southern areas, remained predominantly Berber until the French colonial period. Berber's lack of a standard writing system and its absence as a language of scholarship or administration, particularly in religious institutions like Al-Qarawiyyin mosque, contributed to the relatively rapid Arabization of the Maghreb.

The **French occupation of Morocco in 1912** further complicated the linguistic map. The traditional Islamic education system, which largely neglected sciences and emphasized memorization of grammar and jurisprudence, made the ground "ripe" for French to establish itself. The French colonial administration introduced a new educational system with five main components: a European system, a Jewish system, a predominantly French Muslim system, a limited traditional Islamic system, and private "free schools" that were nationalistic in focus. The objective of French schools was to produce limited professionals who would not challenge the occupation, while elite Moroccan children were given French education to prevent exposure to pan-Arabic and pan-Islamic ideas from the Middle East. The French pursued a **"divide and rule" policy concerning the Berbers**, aiming to shield them from Arabic and Islamic culture by establishing Berber schools where Arabic and Islamic manifestations were "resolutely avoided". This policy, which culminated in the infamous **Berber Decree of 1914 (enacted in 1930\)**, aimed to create separate judicial systems for Arabs and Berbers. This decree sparked widespread protests from both Berbers and Arabs. Berbers revolted because they saw it as an attempt to weaken Islam among their community and divide the country, while Arabs viewed it as an attempt to deny Morocco's Muslim and Arab identity. These reactions demonstrated that for Berbers, Classical Arabic was crucial to their identity as Muslims, and for Arabs, it was an anchor to the East and a symbol of unity with other Arab countries. Nationalist leaders like Allal Al-Fassi envisioned a post-independence Morocco as an Arab country with Arabic replacing French in all spheres.

In the **post-colonial period (after 1956\)**, Morocco inherited educational and administrative systems dominated by French. Despite Classical Arabic being recognized as the official language in the constitution, most subjects, apart from religious studies, were taught in French. This situation was unacceptable to independence movement leaders, who advocated for the Arabization of education and administration, viewing the continuing presence of French as a symbol of incomplete independence. Graduates educated in the Middle East saw Morocco as an Arab country tied to the Arab East, arguing that French dominance in administration ignored the interests of the majority of citizens who did not speak it and infringed upon Islam and the national language. Arab nationalists also embraced Arabization, not primarily for religious reasons, but to firmly bind Morocco to other Arab countries, viewing French as an obstacle to pan-Arab unity. This pan-Arab nationalism, which had roots in the Middle East as a reaction to Ottoman rule, sought to establish Arabic as the central language for national and pan-Arab identity, advocating for comprehensive Arabization that would eliminate French, and importantly, local Berber and Arabic dialects from schools, radio, and television.

Conversely, Moroccan elites educated in the French system were less eager for comprehensive Arabization, seeing the continued presence of French as a connection to the West and finding no conflict with Arabic and French coexisting with separate functions. They also did not support a prominent role for Berber. Berber leaders, however, sought official recognition for Berber beyond folkloric representation, feeling threatened by Arab nationalism's emphasis on Arabic. They argued that Arabic could fulfill its religious role while allowing other languages to perform other functions, drawing parallels to countries like Pakistan and Iran where national languages are distinct from the language of religion. They also advocated for French to remain important, hoping it would prevent the Maghreb from being exclusively anchored to the East, which they felt threatened Berber identity. They argued for Arabization and Arabic as the language of Islam and national unity, but also for the creation of a Berber institute to preserve the language and for necessary bilingualism (Arabic/French) to maintain cultural relations with Europe and Africa. These arguments have become more forceful with eased restrictions on media and organizations, with some critics suggesting that Arabization is based solely on ideological considerations rather than linguistic reality. While the French historically tried to use Berber as a wedge during the colonial period, current Berber advocacy for French stems from a concern for their language and identity against the political pan-Arabic overtones of total Arabization.

Currently, elementary and secondary education in Morocco are Arabized, but university education, especially in the sciences, remains predominantly in French. This split creates problems for students with inadequate French backgrounds entering university and incentivizes enrollment in non-science subjects. It also exacerbates a socioeconomic gap, with strong competition for private French schools that only the wealthy can afford. While there is increasing acknowledgement of Berber as part of Moroccan identity, reflected in television news, papers, and magazines, this has not yet translated into concrete efforts like teaching Berber in schools or recognizing it as an official language. In the diaspora, particularly in Europe, there is an active Berber movement advocating for its teaching and development of a writing system, framing it as a human rights issue and asserting a pan-Maghrebi Amazigh national identity. French remains economically important, though English is gaining ground in higher education, with some proposing to replace French with English due to its international dominance and lack of colonial connotations. The complex interaction of these languages is determined by ethnicity, religion, social class, and educational background, making attempts to shift linguistic dominance challenging. Classical Arabic is expected to be maintained due to its religious role, while the maintenance of spoken languages like Berber and Moroccan Arabic will largely depend on ethnic identity.

The **Idrisid dynasty** (788–974 CE, 171–363 AH) was an Arab Muslim lineage that ruled most of present-day Morocco and parts of western Algeria. Named after its founder, Idris I, this dynasty established the first independent Islamic state in Morocco.

### **Origins and Foundation (Idris I)**

The Idrisids were a Hashemite family of Hijazi origin, tracing their lineage back to the Prophet Muhammad through Ali ibn Abi Talib and Fatima Zahra. Their ancestor, **Idris ibn Abdallah al-Kamil**, fled Abbasid persecution after the Battle of Fakh in Mecca in 786 CE and sought refuge in Volubilis in Morocco. There, local Amazigh (Berber) tribes, including the Awraba, pledged allegiance to him as their leader, prince, and imam in 788 CE (171 AH). Idris I began the construction of Fez and expanded his control across northern Morocco, reaching Taza in the East, the Atlantic plains, and Tadla in the South by 791 CE. However, in 793 CE, the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid orchestrated his assassination by poison.

### **Consolidation and Organization (Idris II)**

After Idris I's death, his son **Idris II** was born to his Amazigh wife, Kenza. Idris II assumed the imamate from 804 CE (177 AH) and reigned until 828 CE (213 AH). He played a crucial role in strengthening the nascent state by introducing new structures and institutions. He brought many craftsmen from Al-Andalus and Kairouan, founded Fez, and made it the state capital in 808 CE. He also adopted Islamic administrative systems such as the vizierate, secretariat, judiciary, and imamate. To reduce tribal influence, Fez attracted significant populations from Kairouan and Al-Andalus, fostering a diverse population that facilitated the spread of the Arabic language as the language of religion and culture. Under Idris II, the kingdom expanded significantly, becoming the most important political entity in the Maghreb al-Aqsa and extending its direct influence throughout the country.

### **Period of Division**

Upon Idris II's death, he left behind several sons. His eldest son, **Muhammad ibn Idris II**, succeeded him (828–836 CE). In 836 CE, Muhammad chose to divide the kingdom among his eight or more brothers, viewing it as a family inheritance. This division, while having some benefits, primarily led to the weakening of central authority and the emergence of regional emirates striving for maximum autonomy. The kingdom was divided into at least nine provinces, according to historical accounts:

* Muhammad ibn Idris retained Fez and its surroundings.  
* Al-Qasim ibn Idris received Tangier, Ceuta, Qalat Hajar al-Nisr, Tétouan, and Masmuda lands.  
* Dawud ibn Idris was given Hawwara, Tessoul, Meknes, the Ghayatha Mountains, and Taza.  
* Isa ibn Idris ruled Chellah, Salé, Azemmour, and Tamesna.  
* Yahya ibn Idris controlled Basra and Asilah, Larache, and the lands of Wargha.  
* Omar ibn Idris governed Lixus, Tergha, and the lands of Sanhaja and Ghomara.  
* Ahmad ibn Idris was granted Meknès, Fazaz, and Tadla.  
* Abdallah ibn Idris controlled Aghmat, Nafis, Masamida, and Sous.  
* Hamza ibn Idris ruled Tlemcen and its territories.

Despite Muhammad ibn Idris's intention to maintain central oversight, conflicts soon erupted. Isa ibn Idris rebelled against Muhammad. Muhammad tasked his brother Al-Qasim (governor of Tangier) to suppress the rebellion, but Al-Qasim refused. Muhammad then commissioned Omar, who was governor of Ghomara, to act. Omar deposed Isa and confronted Al-Qasim, who had retreated to Asilah. Historical inquiries suggest the rebellion stemmed from Muhammad's decision to revoke the governors' right to mint coins, which significantly impacted Isa, who governed the silver-rich region of Wazqur. This led Isa to cut off the silver supply to the mint in Fez. Although conflicts occurred, they did not immediately lead to widespread fragmentation, and a truce was likely reached. Political stability within the Idrisid emirates was generally maintained, possibly due to the veneration the family enjoyed among the local Moroccan population, who viewed them as deeply integrated through marriage and local customs rather than as foreign rulers.

### **Later Idrisid Rulers in Fez and Decline**

Fez remained the central capital, ruled by several princes:

* **Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Idris** (836–848 CE) had a reign characterized by peace and prosperity.  
* **Yahya ibn Muhammad** (848–864 CE) oversaw extensive construction in Fez, including the expansion of the city and the building of the renowned Al-Andalus and Al-Qarawiyyin Mosques, attracting migrants from across the Islamic West.  
* **Yahya II ibn Yahya** (864–874 CE) faced a crisis due to his misconduct, leading to a revolt.  
* **Ali ibn Omar** (874–883 CE) stabilized the city but was later defeated by a Kharijite rebel and forced to retreat.  
* **Yahya ibn Al-Qasim ibn Idris** (died 904 CE) successfully defended the Idrisid state in Fez against Kharijite rebels.  
* **Yahya ibn Idris ibn Omar** (904–917 CE) was highly praised by historians like Ibn Khaldun as the "highest in kingship among the Banu Idris" and described as a scholar, Hadith preserver, eloquent speaker, and brave leader.

However, the late 9th and early 10th centuries saw the Idrisids come under severe external threat. The **Fatimids**, newly established in Ifriqiya, sought to extend their control over the entire Maghreb. Masala ibn Habbus al-Miknasi, the Fatimid governor of the Central Maghreb, led an army against the Idrisids, defeating Yahya ibn Idris near Meknes. Yahya was besieged in Fez and forced to surrender, becoming a vassal of the Fatimid Caliph. Masala, however, simultaneously appointed Musa ibn Abi al-Afiyah, his cousin, as head of the Miknasa tribe in Morocco. Musa then worked to undermine the Idrisids, eventually inciting Masala to imprison and exile Yahya, who died in tragic circumstances in 934 CE (332 AH).

A bitter struggle ensued between Musa ibn Abi al-Afiyah and the Idrisids. **Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Qasim**, known as Al-Hajjam, attempted to restore Idrisid authority, capturing Fez and initially defeating Musa. However, Musa retaliated, pursuing Al-Hasan back to Fez, where he was betrayed and died. Musa ibn Abi al-Afiyah then controlled Idrisid lands in northern Morocco, forcing the remaining Idrisids to seek refuge in the formidable fortress of Hajar al-Nisr in the Rif Mountains. The Idrisids' precarious situation was exacerbated by the larger conflict between the Fatimid Caliphate in Ifriqiya and the Umayyad Caliphate in Al-Andalus, with Morocco as their battleground. Despite their attempts at neutrality, the Idrisids were often compelled to submit to either side due to military pressure. Their ties to the Umayyads were perhaps stronger due to geographical proximity and the Umayyads' respectful treatment of Idrisid leaders.

### **End of the Idrisid Dynasty in Morocco**

Despite continuous persecution, the Idrisids maintained a presence through local leadership. Key branches included:

* **Banu Omar**: Based in Sadina (southern Rif), from whom the Hammudids (who briefly ruled Cordoba and later became Taifa kings in Al-Andalus) descended.  
* **Banu Dawud**: Influential in the Sebou Valley.  
* **Banu Al-Qasim**: A significant branch with centers in Basra and Asilah.  
* **Banu Isa**: Located in Wazqur in the Middle Atlas, controlling a silver mine.  
* **Banu Ubaydallah**: Settled in southern Morocco, founding the cities of Tamdoult and Igli, and holding significant spiritual influence.  
* **Banu Sulayman**: Descendants of Idris I's brother, Sulayman, who ruled Tlemcen.

By the mid-10th century, the Idrisids agreed to appoint **Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Al-Qasim** as their leader, who ruled until his death in 948 CE (337 AH). He was succeeded by his son, **Abu al-Aish Ahmad**, a scholar and jurist loyal to the Umayyads. Abu al-Aish chose to end his life fighting in Al-Andalus, where he was martyred in 959 CE (343 AH). His brother, **Al-Hasan ibn Kannun** (959–974 CE), took over. Facing renewed Fatimid attacks, Al-Hasan temporarily shifted his allegiance to them but reverted to the Umayyads once the Fatimid armies withdrew. Another Fatimid army, led by Buluggin ibn Ziri, forced Al-Hasan to again switch allegiance, this time actively participating against Umayyad supporters, which angered the Umayyad Caliph Al-Hakam II.

Al-Hakam II dispatched a large army to Morocco. After fierce battles, Al-Hasan was forced to retreat to Hajar al-Nisr before surrendering and being taken captive to Cordoba in 974 CE (363 AH). After two years, a disagreement with Al-Hakam II led to Al-Hasan and his family's exile to Fatimid Egypt, where they were well received. In 985 CE (373 AH), the Fatimid Caliph provided Al-Hasan with an army to reclaim his emirate in Morocco. However, Al-Mansur ibn Abi Amir sent a powerful army to intercept him. Al-Hasan sought clemency but was assassinated on his way back to Cordoba in 985 CE (375 AH). With the death of Al-Hasan ibn Kannun, the last of their kings, the Idrisid era in Morocco definitively ended.

### **Legacy of the Idrisids**

Despite their eventual decline, the Idrisids played a fundamental role in Moroccan history:

1. They effectively transformed Morocco into an Islamic land, actively spreading Islam throughout various regions.  
2. They initiated the first real attempt to move beyond tribalism by establishing an Islamic-style state with Fez as its capital, marking the true beginning of the Moroccan state in history.  
3. Their urban development efforts included founding new cities, revitalizing old ones, boosting commercial activity, and establishing numerous mints across Morocco.

### **Modern Idrisids and Chronology**

Today, Idrisids are found in the Maghreb countries and the Middle East, with notable historical figures such as Prince Abdelkader al-Jazairi (Algeria), King Mohammed Idris al-Sanusi (Libya), and Sharif Mohammed ibn Ali al-Idrisi (Jizan, Saudi Arabia).

The Idrisid rule spanned approximately 130 years and progressed through three main phases:

* **Foundation Phase**: 41 years, from Idris I to the death of Idris II in 829 CE.  
* **Strength Phase**: 30 years, under Muhammad ibn Idris, Ali ibn Muhammad, and Yahya ibn Muhammad.  
* **Weakness Phase**: 59 years, under Ali ibn Omar, Yahya III, and Yahya IV.

During the foundation and strength phases, the Idrisids successfully unified the country and subjugated various tribes, extending their state from far south Sous to the Rif in the north and beyond Tlemcen in the east.

The **Almoravid State** was a Berber Muslim dynasty centered in present-day Morocco. It established an empire that extended across regions of the Maghreb al-Aqsa (Morocco) and Al-Andalus (Islamic Spain), beginning in the 1050s and lasting until its fall to the Almohad State in 1147 CE. The Almoravids were a hereditary monarchy. The new state emerged from a reformist Islamic religious movement.

### **Name and Origins**

The term "Almoravids" (المرابطون) derives from the Arabic word "*al-Murabit*" (المرابط), meaning "the person who binds" or, metaphorically, "the person ready for battle in the fortress". The name is linked to a Maliki school of Islamic law called "Dar al-Murabitin" (دار المرابطين), founded by the scholar Wajaj ibn Zallu in Souss al-Aqsa (southern Morocco). Wajaj sent his student Abdallah ibn Yasin to preach Maliki Islam among the Sanhaja Berbers. The name "Almoravids" thus refers to the followers of Dar al-Murabitin, "the house of those who were bound together in the path of God". While the exact timing and reasons for adopting this name are debated, it might be related to Wajaj ibn Zallu al-Lamtuni's *ribat* (fortified monastery) in Aklu (near modern Tiznit), where Abdallah ibn Yasin received his initial training.

The Almoravid movement initially relied on the Sanhaja Berber tribes. This tribal alliance transformed into popular support, which then became military backing, leading to the rise of a regional economic power due to their control over trade routes. This was combined with a reformist Islamic spirit based on the Maliki school of thought, leading them to call themselves "the state of *Ribat* and Reform". At the time of their emergence, Morocco was governed by several small states or tribal confederations, including Barghawata, Ghomara, Maghrawa in the center and north, and various Shi'ite and pagan groups in the south. These areas were characterized by continuous conflicts and widespread chaos. The Almoravids aimed to spread Islam and confront those who opposed it.

### **Foundation and Early Expansion**

The Almoravid movement began to take shape when Yahya ibn Ibrahim, a leader of the Juddala tribe, returned from Hajj in 427 AH/1035 CE. In Kairouan, he met Imam Abu Imran al-Fasi, a Maliki jurist from Fez. Yahya explained his people's ignorance of religious principles and asked al-Fasi to send a student to teach them. Abu Imran al-Fasi, who had previously failed to challenge the ruling Maghrawa in Fez, saw this as an opportunity for a reformist jihadist project. He instructed Yahya to seek assistance from his student Wajaj ibn Zallu al-Lamtuni, who ran a *ribat* (religious-military center) in Aklu. Wajaj chose **Abdallah ibn Yasin**, who accompanied Yahya ibn Ibrahim to the Sahara.

Ibn Yasin established a *ribat* near the Senegal River, intentionally close to the Ghana Empire, to train his followers in a jihadist environment and to remain in a constant state of readiness. He emphasized the implementation of Islamic law and gathered scholars around him. After initial efforts to spread the message peacefully, Ibn Yasin declared jihad against the tribes that refused to comply. The first military actions were against the Juddala, then the Lamtuna, and Musufa tribes, all of whom were defeated and submitted.

After Yahya ibn Ibrahim's death in a battle, Ibn Yasin appointed **Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni** as the military leader, giving him the title "Amir al-Haqq" (Prince of Truth). This strategic choice of a Lamtuni leader strengthened the movement by attracting thousands from the Lamtuna tribe.

The Almoravids then focused on **unifying Morocco**. Their first major military campaign was to retake Awdaghost from the Ghana Empire in 447 AH/1056 CE, after which they expanded southward into West Africa, spreading Islam. In 445 AH/1053 CE, a request from the scholars of Sijilmasa and Draa for aid against the Maghrawa Zenata rulers led the Almoravids to march into the Draa region. They defeated the Maghrawa, killed their emir Mas'ud, and captured Sijilmasa, where Ibn Yasin implemented strict Islamic laws, destroying musical instruments, burning places selling alcohol, and abolishing illegal taxes. Sijilmasa later revolted due to the Almoravids' strictness, briefly returning to Maghrawa control.

After the death of Yahya ibn Umar in battle around 448 AH/1056 CE, Abdallah ibn Yasin appointed his brother **Abu Bakr ibn Umar** as the new leader. Abu Bakr quickly moved to conquer the Sous region, where **Yusuf ibn Tashfin** emerged as a key military commander, demonstrating administrative skill after capturing Sijilmasa. The Almoravids conquered Massa and Taroudant, replacing the existing Shi'ite presence with Maliki Sunni Islam. They then besieged and captured Aghmat in 449 AH/1057 CE, where Abu Bakr married Zaynab al-Nafzawiya, the former wife of the Maghrawa emir.

Abdallah ibn Yasin was wounded in successive battles against the Barghawata and died shortly thereafter. Abu Bakr then took on both religious and political leadership, further defeating the Barghawata. In 452 AH/1060 CE, Abu Bakr continued his conquests, opening all the lands of Zenata, Miknasa, and Luwata.

### **Founding of Marrakesh and Yusuf ibn Tashfin's Rise**

Due to overcrowding in Aghmat, Abu Bakr decided to build a new capital. He selected a location between two rival tribes, a wide, uninhabited land traversed by the Nafis River, near Mount Dern. The foundation of **Marrakesh** was laid in 462 AH/1069 CE. Before the city's completion, Abu Bakr left for the Sahara to settle tribal disputes, delegating authority over Morocco to his cousin **Yusuf ibn Tashfin** in 463 AH/1070 CE. Yusuf completed the construction and fortification of Marrakesh, establishing it as the new Almoravid capital.

Abu Bakr later formally relinquished his rule over Morocco to Yusuf ibn Tashfin, citing Yusuf's piety, courage, and justice. Abu Bakr then continued his jihad in the Sahara against pagan tribes. He divorced Zaynab al-Nafzawiya, advising her to marry Yusuf, which she did after her waiting period, further solidifying Yusuf's position.

Yusuf ibn Tashfin continued the unification of Morocco. He skillfully exploited divisions among the Zenata leaders and entered Fez without a fight in 455 AH/1067 CE. After suppressing a rebellion and recapturing Fez, he broke the power of Zenata tribes, including Maghrawa and Banu Ifran, and organized the city's mosques, hotels, and markets. By 467 AH/1074 CE, Yusuf had extended his control over almost all of northern Morocco, excluding Tangier and Ceuta. He then opened cities in the Central Maghreb, including Oujda, Tlemcen, and Oran, reaching Algiers, where he built the Great Mosque. By 475 AH/1081 CE, after thirty years of fighting, Morocco was unified under Almoravid rule.

### **The Conquest of Al-Andalus**

With Morocco unified, Yusuf ibn Tashfin turned his attention to **Al-Andalus**. The Muslim Taifa kingdoms were fragmented and warring, allowing Alfonso VI of Castile to expand his control, including taking Toledo. The people of Al-Andalus appealed to the Almoravids for help, including delegations of judges from Seville, Badajoz, and Granada. Yusuf agreed to cross into Al-Andalus, first securing Algeciras from the Taifa king al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad to establish a secure crossing point.

Yusuf ibn Tashfin declared a general mobilization for jihad, gathering forces from across Morocco. The first units crossed to Algeciras in mid-Rabi' al-Awwal 479 AH/1086 CE, followed by Yusuf and his senior commanders. He then marched to Badajoz, resting in Seville for three days before calling upon the Taifa kings to join the jihad. The combined Almoravid and Andalusian forces met Alfonso VI's Castilian army at the **Battle of Zallaqa** in 479 AH/1086 CE, securing a major victory for the Muslims. After the victory, Yusuf ibn Tashfin was granted the title "**Amir al-Muslimin**" (Commander of the Muslims).

However, the Taifa kings quickly resumed their internal conflicts and even paid tribute to Alfonso VI. In response, Yusuf ibn Tashfin returned to Al-Andalus in 481 AH/1088 CE, intending to depose the Taifa kings and unify Al-Andalus with Morocco. He crossed for the third time in 483 AH/1090 CE, capturing Granada and exiling its ruler Abdallah ibn Buluggin. His commanders then proceeded to depose other Taifa rulers, capturing Cordoba in 484 AH/1091 CE, followed by Seville, Almeria, and Murcia. Yusuf left the Banu Hud in Zaragoza to defend against Christian attacks. The Almoravids faced significant resistance in Valencia from El Cid (Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar), but eventually conquered the city in Rajab 495 AH/1102 CE.

Yusuf ibn Tashfin made his fourth and final crossing in 490 AH/1096 CE. He led an army against Castile, defeating Alfonso VI near Consuegra in 491 AH/1097 CE. He returned to Marrakesh, leaving his son Ali in charge of Al-Andalus with instructions to form a standing army to defend the fortresses and frontiers. Yusuf ibn Tashfin died in Marrakesh on 1 Muharram 500 AH/2 September 1106 CE.

### **Reign of Ali ibn Yusuf and Decline**

**Ali ibn Yusuf** succeeded his father in 1106 CE. He made administrative changes and appointed his older brother Abu Tahir Tamim ibn Yusuf as supreme commander of all Almoravid armies in Al-Andalus. Under Ali, Almoravid influence in Al-Andalus reached its peak in the first ten years of his reign. Zaragoza, the last of the Taifa kingdoms, submitted to Almoravid rule in 503 AH/1110 CE. The Almoravid forces achieved victories, including recapturing Lisbon and other cities in western Al-Andalus.

However, the Almoravid state entered a period of **decline**. Alfonso I of Aragon launched a major offensive against Zaragoza, capturing it in 3 Ramadan 512 AH/18 December 1118 CE after a severe siege, despite Almoravid efforts to relieve the city. This loss marked a significant blow to Almoravid prestige. In 514 AH/1120 CE, the Almoravids suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Cutanda against Alfonso I, further damaging their reputation. In 519 AH/1125 CE, Alfonso I conducted a deep raid into Al-Andalus, prompting a fatwa from Qadi Ibn Rushd al-Jadd, leading to the forced displacement of Christian Mozarabs from Granada to Meknes and Salé in Morocco due to their perceived collaboration with Alfonso. In 528 AH/1134 CE, the Almoravids decisively defeated Alfonso I at the Battle of Fraga, where Alfonso was mortally wounded.

Despite these military engagements, the Almoravid state began facing internal and external pressures. An **economic crisis** hit the state, marked by severe floods in Tangier (532 AH), locust infestations in Al-Andalus (526-531 AH) leading to famine and plague, and large fires in the markets of Cordoba and Fez. This, combined with insecurity and rising living costs due to the ongoing Almohad advance, caused a massive migration of Berbers from Morocco to Al-Andalus around 535 AH/1140 CE.

The **Almohad movement** emerged as a major threat during Ali ibn Yusuf's later reign. Founded by Ibn Tumart, who denounced Almoravid religious corruption and laxity, the Almohads gained followers in the Atlas Mountains. Ali ibn Yusuf tried to suppress the Almohads, but they grew in strength, engaging in numerous battles and besieging cities like Fez and Meknes.

After Ali ibn Yusuf's death in 1143 CE, his son **Tashfin ibn Ali** became heir. Tashfin focused on confronting the Almohads in Morocco, but his efforts failed. The Almohads, under Abd al-Mu'min ibn Ali, captured several cities and received pledges of allegiance from Almoravid commanders, including the head of the Almoravid fleet in Cadiz. Tashfin ibn Ali was killed in 1145 CE.

**Ibrahim ibn Tashfin**, aged 14, briefly succeeded him, but his uncle Ishaq ibn Ali refused his rule, leading to internal conflict within Marrakesh as the Almohads besieged the city. In 18 Shawwal 541 AH/March 1147 CE, the Almohads entered Marrakesh, ending the Almoravid dynasty with a brutal massacre of its inhabitants and the Lamtuna tribe, including the young Ibrahim. Some Almoravid remnants, known as the Banu Ghaniya, continued to rule in the Balearic Islands and parts of Ifriqiya, maintaining the Abbasid allegiance and the Maliki school of thought against the Almohads.

### **Almoravid Policy and Administration**

The Almoravid administrative system was an **emirate of Muslims**, based on the principle of *shura* (consultation) in selecting the emir. The emir of Muslims was the supreme commander. Cities were governed by governors (*wulat*) chosen from the Sanhaja, particularly the Lamtuna tribe, based on their piety, justice, and administrative and military competence. These governors were closely monitored by the emir and his deputies, who could transfer or dismiss them for negligence or incompetence. Deputies often held significant political and military authority, especially in Al-Andalus, where they were tasked with confronting rebellions and leading wars. Prominent deputies included Sir ibn Abi Bakr, Ali ibn Yusuf, Tamim ibn Yusuf, and Muhammad ibn Aisha.

Initially, Almoravid emirs relied on scribes, but later adopted a ministerial system. Ministers, often from the Lamtuna tribe, managed financial and administrative affairs and served as trusted advisors. Military ministers, like Sir ibn Abi Bakr, and scribal ministers, who were jurists, also existed. The Almoravid administration also established a **Chancery Department** (Diwan al-Insha'), led by renowned Andalusian literary figures.

#### **Title of Emirate**

After Abu Bakr ibn Umar's death in 480 AH/1087 CE, Yusuf ibn Tashfin was proposed the title "Amir al-Mu'minin" (Commander of the Faithful) by jurists. However, Yusuf considered this title exclusive to the Abbasid Caliphs, who descended from the Prophet's family and ruled Mecca and Medina. Recognizing the Abbasid Caliph as the sole legitimate representative of the Islamic Caliphate, Yusuf adopted the titles "**Amir al-Muslimin**" (Commander of the Muslims) and "Nasir al-Din" (Defender of the Faith). This implicitly recognized Abbasid legitimacy while asserting his political authority over the Maghreb and Al-Andalus. Almoravid coinage, like the Sijilmasi dinars, initially bore ambiguous recognition of the Abbasid Caliph, but later, especially during Abu Bakr ibn Umar's rule (440-480 AH/1058-1087 CE), the phrase "Abdallah Amir al-Mu'minin" appeared, raising questions about whether it referred to the Almoravid founder or the Abbasid Caliph. Maliki jurists explained that Yusuf's title required Abbasid approval, leading him to send a delegation to Baghdad, headed by Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi and Qadi Ibn al-Qasim. Caliph al-Mustazhir Billah approved Yusuf's request, confirming the continuation of the caliphal tradition and acknowledging the Sanhaja family of Banu Wartanatiq (from which Yusuf descended) as the political authority in the Islamic West, with the duty to protect its frontiers and uphold the Maliki *madhhab* (school of thought).

#### **Judiciary**

The Almoravids granted extensive powers and independence to judges, providing them with financial support and executive authority. The judicial system was hierarchical, with a general head of the judicial institution, usually in Marrakesh, and regional heads known as "*Qadi al-Jama'a*" (Chief Judge) in Morocco and Al-Andalus. Prominent judges included Ibn Hamdin, Ibn Rushd al-Jadd, and Ibn al-Hajj al-Qurtubi. Almoravid emirs encouraged impartiality, instructing judges to treat the strong and weak equally. Judges also had advisory councils of scholars and supervised state expenditures, particularly for endowments and public interests, acting as both "disbursing officers" and "state inspectors". Almoravid emirs preferred Moroccan judges for these roles. Jewish communities were allowed to maintain their own courts for internal disputes, without Almoravid interference. However, in cases involving both Muslims and Jews, disputes were brought before Muslim courts.

### **External Relations**

#### **Abbasid Caliphate**

The first official contact between the Almoravids and the Abbasids occurred after the Battle of Zallaqa and Yusuf ibn Tashfin's conquest of Al-Andalus. However, informal connections predated this, as Abu Imran al-Fasi and his Maliki scholars were adherents of the Abbasid Caliphate. Abbasid caliphs' names were inscribed on Almoravid coins, initially alongside Abu Bakr ibn Umar, and later with Yusuf ibn Tashfin.

#### **Hammadid State**

Relations with the Hammadid state in Algeria were complex. Initially, the Hammadids (also Sanhaja Berbers) supported the Almoravids against common Zenata enemies. However, after the Almoravids seized Tlemcen, relations deteriorated. Despite Almoravid efforts to maintain good ties, the Hammadids seized opportunities to attack Almoravid territories, particularly during Yusuf ibn Tashfin's campaigns in Al-Andalus. Yusuf avoided prolonged war with them, seeing them as a buffer against the more dangerous Banu Hilal Arabs. He sought reconciliation, emphasizing the need for Muslim unity against Christians. Relations improved later, especially with the emergence of the Almohad threat.

#### **Mediterranean Sea**

The Almoravids engaged in naval activities to protect their Atlantic coasts and northern strongholds like Ceuta and Tangier. After their conquest of Al-Andalus, the Almoravid fleet grew to about 100 ships, stationed in major ports like Ceuta, Cadiz, and Almeria. Their shipbuilding industry, particularly in Almeria, gained international renown. The fleet participated in the siege of Ceuta in 476 AH/1083 CE and played a crucial role in transporting Almoravid forces to Al-Andalus. Under Ali ibn Yusuf, the navy flourished, reaching ten fleets by 1144 CE. The Almoravid fleet also launched pre-emptive attacks against Norman ships in the Mediterranean, reaching the coasts of Sicily, Galicia, and Catalonia to counter early Crusader activities.

### **Military Structure**

The Almoravid army was a new, organized, and professionally trained force dedicated to military life. Its core consisted of the *Mulaththamin* (veiled Sanhaja tribesmen), known for their strength and effectiveness in battle. As the state expanded, the army integrated new elements, including **Andalusian Arabs** (some of whom had settled in Morocco during the Idrisid era), and a fighting contingent of **Banu Hilal Arabs**. Yusuf ibn Tashfin also formed a personal **Special Guard** of 2,000 courageous soldiers recruited from various regions, including a Black Guard and Andalusian Christian youths who were often converted to Islam. These guards were chosen for their good physique, bravery, and skill.

#### **Navy**

To protect its extensive coastlines and strategic ports, particularly after incorporating Al-Andalus, the Almoravids developed a significant **naval fleet** . This fleet, which grew to about a hundred ships, was stationed in key ports such as Ceuta, Cadiz, and Almeria . Shipbuilding, especially in Almeria, became internationally renowned . The navy comprised transport and combat vessels, assisting ground forces and playing a role in the conquest of the Balearic Islands and other territories . Its strength peaked under Ali ibn Yusuf .

#### **Flags and Banners**

Flags and banners played a prominent role in the Almoravid military system, symbolizing their unique combat traditions and high morale. Abu Ubayd al-Bakri described the Almoravids' fighting spirit and tactical discipline, noting that they would stand when the banner was upright and sit when it leaned, fighting to the death rather than retreating. Ibn al-Khatib stated that the Almoravid banner was **black**, like that of the Abbasids, rectangular, multi-colored, and adorned with gold. Made of pure silk, these banners often bore Qur'anic verses in Kufic script, such as "There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah" and "Victory comes only from Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise". The use of different colored banners also identified various tribal units within the Almoravid army, especially after it diversified with Berber, Andalusian, and Arab elements.

### **Culture**

The Almoravids, although originating from a desert environment, quickly embraced and fostered the rich civilization of the regions they conquered, particularly Al-Andalus.

#### **Literature and Language**

The Almoravids adopted **Arabic as the official language** of administration and the state across their territories. They encouraged scholars and literary figures from Al-Andalus to settle in Morocco, which significantly contributed to the Arabization of the Maghreb. Arabic had not been an official language in Morocco before the Almoravids. The era saw the production of numerous legal works in the Maliki *madhhab*.

Many notable literary figures emerged, including Qadi Iyad al-Sabti, Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi, and Ibn Bassam, who documented Andalusian literary life. Ibn al-Sayrafi, one of the Almoravid poets, authored "Taqsi al-Anba' wa Siyasat al-Ru'asa'" and "al-Anwar al-Jaliyya fi Akhbar al-Dawla al-Murabitiya". Poetry, particularly the Andalusian *zajal* and *muwashshah*, flourished during this period. Poets like Ibn Quzman, the leader of Andalusian *zajal*, gained prominence. The Almoravids appreciated this popular form of poetry, which blended Arabic and Iberian cultures. Despite the flourishing of popular poetry, the era also witnessed a revival of Arab-Islamic thought through philosophers like Ibn Rushd and Ibn Tufail. Women played a significant role in literary and social life, holding literary gatherings, and some, like Hawa bint Ibrahim ibn Tafliwit and Tamima bint Yusuf ibn Tashfin, were praised by poets for their charitable acts.

#### **Education**

The Almoravids prioritized education from the early days of their movement, spreading it throughout Morocco, even to remote villages. Upon entering Al-Andalus, they discovered new horizons in learning. They focused on educating both boys and girls from a young age. The traditional system of Quranic schools (*mahḍara* or *masjid*) continued, often located in mosques or teachers' homes. Students, including adults who left work, would often fund their own education. Teachers were typically pious elders, and a high standard of conduct and instruction was expected, though not always adhered to. Early education focused on the Quran, Arabic language rules, calligraphy, proper recitation, and basic arithmetic. Qadi Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi notably advocated for prioritizing Arabic and poetry over other sciences. Libraries, both large and small, proliferated, and travel for advanced studies between Morocco and Al-Andalus was common. Many Andalusian scholars, jurists, and poets also traveled to Marrakesh, offering their talents and services to the Almoravid rulers .

#### **Architecture**

Almoravid architecture blended with the distinctive Andalusian style, creating a unique hybrid. Morocco became a "visual extension of Al-Andalus". Yusuf ibn Tashfin brought artisans from Cordoba to Fez, who built hotels, baths, and water fountains. His son Ali commissioned Andalusian engineers to build the Tansift Bridge at the entrance to Marrakesh. Almoravid monuments showcased Moroccan-Andalusian art, notably in religious buildings like the Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fez and the Great Mosque of Tlemcen. The Qarawiyyin Mosque was expanded under Ali ibn Yusuf, acquiring adjacent land from Jewish owners through purchase, not seizure. The Almoravids also built numerous forts, walls, and castles, especially in Al-Andalus, employing decorative inlay techniques. The famous minbar (pulpit) of the Kutubiyya Mosque in Marrakesh was crafted in Cordoba between 1137 and 1147 CE, made of cedar and pine wood, designed to be movable on wheels. The construction of city walls was sometimes delayed; Marrakesh, their capital, remained without walls for seventy years until the Almohad threat emerged.

#### **Sciences**

Despite originating from a desert environment, the Almoravid state attracted scholars and put their expertise to its service, becoming a center of civilization and organization. While some historians, particularly Orientalists, characterized the Almoravid era as one of stagnation and suppression of philosophical sciences, it saw a flourishing of medical, astronomical, linguistic, and historical sciences. Prominent scholars included the geographer Al-Sharif al-Idrisi, known for his "Nuzhat al-Mushtaq fi Ikhtiraq al-Afaq" (The Excursion of One Eager to Traverse the Horizons), and Abu Ubayd al-Bakri, author of "Kitab al-Masalik wa al-Mamalik" (Book of Roads and Kingdoms). Mathematical, astronomical, and philosophical sciences also thrived, with figures like Ibn Bajja (Avempace), who served as a minister to the Almoravids. Ibn Bajja authored works on logic, geometry, mathematics, and philosophy, including "Tadbir al-Mutawahhid" (The Governance of the Solitary). Although accused of heresy by some, he remained a minister for twenty years before being poisoned in Fez. Other notable scientists included the physician Ibn Zuhr, whose "Al-Taisir fi al-Mudawat wa al-Tadbir" (Book of Simplification Concerning Therapeutics and Diet) significantly influenced European medicine.

#### **Economy**

At the outset of their movement, Almoravid revenues primarily came from *zakat*, *kharaj*, *jizya*, spoils of war (*ghanima*), and *ushur* (tithes). Upon establishing Marrakesh as their capital, they implemented an Islamic financial system, abolishing unlawful taxes imposed by the Zenata, such as *magharim* and *mukus*, and established a public treasury that accumulated unprecedented wealth.

The Almoravids' gold dinars were widely respected due to their high purity (up to 96% gold), sourced from the gold mines and trade routes of Ghana, which they controlled. This made the Almoravid dinar a standard currency in international trade, even circulating in Christian Europe until the 19th century under the name *Maravedí*.

Economically, the Almoravids developed agriculture, especially barley and date palms, in oases like Sijilmasa, and cultivated crops like melons, squash, cotton, and sugarcane. They also engaged in animal husbandry, raising camels for transport and resources, and mules and donkeys for local transport. Taroudant became known for sugarcane, wool, cotton, and camel hair textiles. Aghmat exported copper, textiles, wool, glass, stones, spices, and iron products to West Africa. Salt, extracted in slabs by slaves and transported by camels to Sudan and Ghana, was a crucial commodity and was even used as a form of currency. Jewish traders, with their extensive networks, played a pivotal role in facilitating trade between the Islamic West, the East, and Europe, especially after the unification of Al-Andalus and Morocco. The large Moroccan fleet also secured trade routes, fostering commercial activity with Western European countries.

### **Society**

The Almoravid society was predominantly Berber (Amazigh) in the Maghreb, but it also included Arab populations (especially Banu Hilal and their allies) and a significant presence of sub-Saharan Africans. Africans from south of the Sahara were recruited into the Almoravid armies, and women were employed in household services or as concubines, noted for their culinary skills.

**Women** held a respected position, participating in tribal councils and exercising influence over men. Almoravid leaders sometimes took their mothers' names (e.g., Ibn Aisha, Ibn Ghaniya). Zaynab al-Nafzawiya, Yusuf ibn Tashfin's wife, was particularly influential, described by Ibn Khaldun as "one of the world's most famous women in beauty and leadership". Even Christian women in the royal family influenced state policy.

#### **Christians and Mozarabs**

Christians in Al-Andalus lived mainly in cities like Granada, Seville, Valencia, and Cordoba, and some rural areas, likely in large numbers. Mozarabs (indigenous Spanish Christians who adopted Arab culture or converted to Islam) were particularly active in economic life, excelling in various professions, trade, and agriculture. Many Christians achieved high social status and influence, especially under Ali ibn Yusuf, who showed them considerable patronage. They were allowed to share public facilities like wells with Muslims and participate in prayers for rain. The Almoravid state protected their social rights and provided special cemeteries for them. However, some jurists called for strict measures against Christian women entering churches for reasons other than religious holidays due to perceived immoral behavior. Christians, while typically wearing their own distinctive clothing, also adopted Muslim attire, a practice some jurists tried to curb.

Ali ibn Yusuf, born to a Christian mother, was the first to widely employ Europeans in Morocco, not only in the army but also in administrative roles, such as tax collection in mountainous regions. Prominent Christian figures, like the Catalan noble Reverter I, held high positions and fought alongside Tashfin ibn Ali against the Almohads. Some, like Ali ibn Reverter (Reverter's son), converted to Islam and became Almoravid military commanders. Slavs (*Saqaliba*) also served as Almoravid guards. Christians were granted autonomy in managing their civil and religious affairs through a system where local leaders, known as *qawāmis*, were responsible for their communities to the Muslim authorities. They had their own independent courts led by a "Qadi al-Nasara" (Judge of Christians). Despite this, some faced harassment and forced displacement, especially those who assisted Alfonso I of Aragon during his campaigns in southern Al-Andalus. A significant expulsion of Mozarabs occurred in 519 AH/1125 CE, with many resettling in Marrakesh, Salé, and Meknes. War captives, particularly from the Battle of Zallaqa, also increased the Christian population in Morocco.

#### **Jews**

Jews in Al-Andalus flourished after adopting Arab-Islamic civilization, developing their own schools and producing significant intellectual and literary works. Upon the Almoravids' arrival, Jews held considerable influence in Al-Andalus, with large numbers settling in cities like Granada (which was sometimes called "the city of Jews") and Lucena. While the Almoravid state largely respected Jewish legal autonomy, some sources indicate a period of hardship. Many Jewish scholars emigrated from the Iberian Peninsula, fleeing pressure to convert to Islam or face death. Notable rabbis, philosophers, and scholars emerged, such as Samuel al-Fasi (Samuel Marochitanus), who converted to Christianity and held high Almoravid positions. Ibn Ezra, a polymath, and Musa ibn Maymun (Maimonides), who grew up under Almoravid rule and wrote most of his works in Arabic, were also prominent. Jewish families like the Banu Tibbon were renowned for their translation work. Jews also played roles in administration and held ministerial positions, such as Abu Ya'qub Sulayman ibn al-Mu'allim and Sulayman ibn Farusal, who was assassinated during a diplomatic mission.

Towards the end of the Almoravid rule, especially under Ali ibn Yusuf, some precautionary measures were taken against Jews in Marrakesh, prohibiting them from staying in the capital overnight due to internal conflicts and the threat of Ibn Tumart. Some fatwas (religious edicts) supported punishing Jews and Christians who imitated Muslims in dress and prohibited them from supervising Muslims in their homes or selling alcohol and pork in Muslim markets. Ibn Abdun, an Andalusian jurist, advised against selling scientific books to Jews, claiming they would appropriate Muslim scholarship.

### **Rulers**

The Almoravid rulers and their approximate years of rule were:

1. Yahya ibn Ibrahim (1042-1043 CE)  
2. Abdallah ibn Yasin (1043-1055 CE)  
3. Abu Bakr ibn Umar (1055-1071 CE)  
4. Yusuf ibn Tashfin (1071-1106 CE)  
5. Ali ibn Yusuf (1106-1143 CE)  
6. Tashfin ibn Ali (1143-1145 CE)  
7. Ibrahim ibn Tashfin (1145-1145 CE)  
8. Ishaq ibn Ali (1145-1147 CE)

Morocco's rich history is characterized by a succession of influential dynasties that have shaped its identity, culture, and architectural heritage, making it a internationally recognized multicultural nation with diverse UNESCO World Heritage sites. The nation is a preferred destination for tourists interested in nature, history, art of living, and Moroccan hospitality.

### **Idrisid Dynasty (789-974, 1465-1472)**

The **Idrisid dynasty** was the first royal dynasty to govern Morocco, founded by Idris I, who initially established Volubilis as its capital. From 789 to 978, the Idrisids exerted control over a significant portion of the Maghreb, encompassing present-day North Africa. During their rule, they were instrumental in building new cities, with Fez becoming the capital after Volubilis under Idris II and his successors. Numerous monuments attest to their architectural and religious contributions, notably the **Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque**, considered one of Morocco's most important mosques and a true architectural masterpiece. After several years of governance, the Idrisid dynasty fell, paving the way for the Almoravids.

### **Almoravid Dynasty (1060-1147)**

Following the Idrisids, the **Almoravids** emerged, expanding their rule across parts of the Maghreb region. They established **Marrakesh in 1062**, which became their capital and a crucial trade hub connecting sub-Saharan Africa with the Maghreb. The Almoravids constructed numerous religious sites, including mosques like the **Koutoubia Mosque**, whose construction began during their era, as well as Quranic schools, city walls, and palaces. They also developed an irrigation system to supply water to the entire region. The Almoravid dynasty's rule eventually ended when they were overthrown by the Almohads.

### **Almohad Dynasty (1145-1248)**

The **Almohads** conquered Morocco, deposing the Almoravid dynasty. Under the command of Ibn Tumart, they declared war on the Almoravids in the name of religion, advocating for strict monotheism, which is reflected in their name. The architectural and cultural legacy of this dynasty remains deeply embedded in iconic landmarks of Marrakesh, their capital. A notable achievement was the restoration of the **Koutoubia Mosque**, whose architecture was designed in the style of the Giralda in Seville. The Almohad dynasty ruled for approximately half a century but weakened following a defeat against the Christians in 1212\.

### **Marinid Dynasty (1244-1465)**

Founded by the Berber leader Abu Yahya, the **Marinid dynasty** established Fez as its capital after overthrowing the Almohads and expelling them from the Maghreb. Their reign, however, was not long-lived, as they were defeated by the Portuguese who launched attacks on the coast via Ceuta and the Strait of Gibraltar. Driven by religious values, the Marinids built numerous Zawiyas, mosques, and Quranic schools, such as those found in Salé. This dynasty was distinguished by various achievements and architectural principles, including **wood and plaster decorations, patterned tiled roofs, and diverse ceramics**. The Chellah Necropolis in Rabat contains remnants that testify to the rich culture, history, architecture, and religious institutions of this dynasty.

### **Saadian Dynasty (1554-1659)**

The **Saadian dynasty** ousted the Marinids from power, initially making Fez their capital before relocating it to Marrakesh. They declared war on the Portuguese and successfully reclaimed several cities, most notably **Agadir**. The Saadians formed an alliance with Spain to safeguard themselves from Turkish threats. Under the Saadians, Morocco experienced a **golden age**, flourishing in culture, knowledge, and wealth. They acquired gold from Sudan following their defeat of the African Songhai Empire. The dynasty also commissioned many artistic works, including the construction of a tower in Fez and proposed alterations to the Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque. In Marrakesh, they built the **Saadian Tombs, Ben Youssef Madrasa, and the El Badi Palace**. The Saadians were eventually dethroned by the Alaouite dynasty.

### **Alaouite Dynasty (1666-Present)**

The **Alaouites**, whose origins trace back to Tafilalt, removed the Saadians to assume royal power. They initially established Fez as their capital, which was later moved to Meknes under Sultan Moulay Ismail, and ultimately to **Rabat, the current capital of Morocco since 1912**. This dynasty brought about significant transformation in Fez, improving the city's landmarks and constructing walls, including the renowned **Bab Mansour gate**. The Alaouite dynasty continues to rule Morocco to this day, with **Mohammed VI** serving as the twenty-third king, dedicated to ensuring the kingdom's unity and upholding its religious values.

The history of Morocco is extensive, dating back to ancient times and marked by a succession of civilizations and dynasties that have shaped its unique identity, culture, and political landscape.

### **Prehistoric Eras (Early Stone Age to Bronze Age)**

Morocco's prehistoric past reveals a long history of human habitation and cultural development. Archaeological findings indicate human presence in the region for at least 400,000 years, with evidence of early human species and, notably, the oldest Homo sapiens remains discovered globally.

* **Early Discoveries:** Fossilized bones of a 400,000-year-old human were found in Salé in 1971\. In 1991, remains found in Jebel Irhoud were later dated in 2017 to at least 300,000 years old, making them the earliest known Homo sapiens fossils. Perforated shell beads, considered the oldest personal ornaments, were discovered in Taforalt Cave (82,000 years old) in 2007 and in Bizmoune Cave (over 142,000 years old) in 2021\.  
* **Stone Age Civilizations:** The **Acheulean Civilization** dates back approximately 700,000 years, with evidence from Thomas Quarries in Casablanca showing remains of *Homo erectus* and stone tools. The **Mousterian Civilization** emerged at least 300,000 years ago, with its earliest traces in Jebel Irhoud and its last appearance 80,000 years ago. This period saw advancements in human tools and adapted to initial humid, then arid, climatic changes. The **Aterian Civilization**, considered native to Morocco, originated over 145,000 years ago. Aterian people specialized in hunting gazelles using stemmed tools like arrows and spears, and also hunted large animals, demonstrating adaptability to new climates. The **Iberomaurusian Civilization** marked the Upper Stone Age, beginning around 22,000 years ago. This period saw significant population growth, artistic, cultural, and organizational innovations, with specialized tools for processing meat, hides, and bones. Key findings include numerous human remains and artifacts in Taforalt Cave.  
* **Neolithic and Bronze Age:** The **Capsian Civilization** flourished in Morocco and North Africa between 8000 BCE and 2700 BCE. Discoveries at Under Ghar Cave indicate the presence of **Cardial** (Neolithic) and **Bell Beaker** (Bronze Age) civilizations, evidenced by pottery, ceramics, tools, and weapons. The geography of Morocco during the Middle Stone Age (20,000-5000 years ago) was more like a savanna, supporting hunter-gatherer cultures before the region became drier after 5000 BCE, leading to the development of early agriculture and cattle domestication.

### **Classical Era (8th Century BCE \- 7th Century CE)**

This era saw significant external influences, laying the groundwork for later political entities.

* **Phoenician and Carthaginian Influence:** Recorded history for Morocco begins with Phoenician colonization of the coast between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE, establishing trading posts and integrating Morocco into Mediterranean trade networks. Lixus and Thymiaterion are notable early cities. Carthage expanded its dominance over these coastal areas from the 5th to the late 3rd century BCE, and Carthaginian explorer Hanno established several trading centers along the Atlantic coast. These societies adopted Punic culture, developing livestock farming and pottery production.  
* **Kingdom of Mauretania:** An independent Amazigh kingdom, Mauretania, emerged around 300 BCE, extending from the Moulouya Valley to the Atlantic and from northern Morocco to the southern Atlas Mountains. Under kings like Bocchus I, its political reach extended into central Algeria. Rome's interest in the region grew, leading to Juba II being installed as king under Roman protection in 25 BCE.  
* **Roman Period:** Following the assassination of Ptolemy (Juba II's son) in 40 CE, Rome annexed Mauretania, dividing it into Mauretania Tingitana (northern Morocco, with Tingis/Volubilis as capital) and Mauretania Caesariensis (northern Algeria). Roman control, primarily through alliances rather than military occupation, focused on economically beneficial coastal plains. Christianity was introduced in the 2nd century CE, spreading among urban populations, slaves, and Amazigh peasants, with some Christian movements serving as political protests. After the 3rd century CE, Roman authority weakened, and local Amazigh rule re-emerged, enduring through Vandal invasions and Byzantine attempts to restore imperial control, which largely failed to extend beyond Ceuta.

### **Early Islamic Era (8th Century \- 11th Century)**

The arrival of Islam fundamentally transformed Morocco's political and cultural landscape, leading to the establishment of the first independent Islamic states.

* **Islamic Conquest and Berber Revolt:** The Islamic conquest of Morocco began in the mid-7th century and was completed by the early 8th century, spreading Arabic language and Islam. Indigenous Berbers embraced Islam but retained their customary laws and paid taxes to the new Islamic administration. However, in 740 CE, Amazigh tribes revolted against the ruling Umayyad Caliphate, instigated by Kharijite teachings. This Berber Revolt led to Morocco's secession from Umayyad and Abbasid control, fragmenting it into several small, independent Amazigh states.  
* **Independent Amazigh Emirates:**  
  * **Burghwata State:** The first independent Islamic kingdom to emerge from the Caliphate's rule, the Burghwata governed the Tamesna region (from Salé to Safi) for over three centuries (744-1058 CE).  
  * **Nekor Emirate:** Established in 744 CE in the Rif region by Salih ibn Mansour, it was the first independent Islamic emirate in the Far Maghreb and adhered to Sunni Islam, unlike other contemporary Kharijite emirates.  
  * **Banu Midrar (Sijilmasa):** This emirate, mentioned as one of the independent states, was a significant entity at the "gate to the Sahara".  
  * **Idrisid Dynasty (788-974 CE):** Founded by Idris ibn Abdallah al-Mahd, a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, who fled Abbasid persecution and was welcomed by the Awraba Amazigh tribe in Volubilis in 788 CE. Idris I expanded control across northern Morocco before his assassination. His son, Idris II, established Fez as the capital in 808 CE and expanded the state's influence. The Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque was founded during their rule. Despite fragmentation and eventual subjugation by the Fatimids and Umayyads of Córdoba, the Idrisids laid the foundation for an independent Moroccan state.  
  * **Maghrawa State:** Led by Ziri ibn Atiyya (d. 1001), the Maghrawa extended their influence to Fez and consolidated their rule in northern and central Morocco. They remained largely loyal to the Umayyads of Córdoba, ruling Fez for about a century until their defeat by the Almoravids.  
  * **Banu Ifran** and **Miknasa**: Other significant Zenata Berber tribes mentioned as operating independently or in alliance with larger powers during this fragmented period.

### **Imperial Dynasties (11th Century \- 17th Century)**

Morocco experienced periods of significant unification and expansion under powerful dynasties, establishing vast empires.

* **Almoravid State (1060-1147 CE):** Originating from the nomadic Sanhaja Berber tribes in the Sahara, the Almoravids were a religious reform movement led by Abdallah ibn Yasin. They founded Marrakesh as their capital in 1069 CE. Under Yusuf ibn Tashfin, the Almoravids unified all of present-day Morocco, parts of western Algeria, and Al-Andalus, establishing the first unified Moroccan state extending from north to south.  
* **Almohad State (1147-1269 CE):** Led by the religious reformer Mahdi Ibn Tumart, the Almohads organized the Masmuda tribes to overthrow the Almoravids, whom they accused of religious deviation. Under Abd al-Mu'min ibn Ali, they seized control of all of the Far Maghreb by 1147 CE and expanded their empire across North Africa and Al-Andalus, creating the largest empire in the Western Mediterranean since the Roman Empire.  
* **Marinid State (1269-1465 CE):** A Zenata Amazigh tribe, the Marinids overthrew the Almohads in 1269 CE, making Fez their capital. They conquered several cities, fought in Al-Andalus, and expanded into Algeria. The Marinids reached their peak under Abu al-Hassan Ali and Abu Inan Faris, who conquered Tlemcen and Tunis. However, they failed to maintain the vast Almohad legacy, and their rule ended with the fragmentation of Morocco into two kingdoms (Fez and Marrakesh) and the loss of coastal cities to Iberian occupation. A revolt in Fez against the last Marinid sultan, Abd al-Haqq, brought their rule to an end.  
* **Wattasid State (1471-1554 CE):** Another Zenata Amazigh dynasty, the Wattasids had served as viziers to the Marinids before seizing power after their decline. Their rule, largely confined to northern Morocco, lasted from 1471 to 1554 CE, facing challenges from internal fragmentation and external pressures.  
* **Saadian State (1510/1525-1659 CE):** This Sharifian dynasty (claiming descent from the Prophet Muhammad) emerged from southern Morocco (Draa region) as a jihadist resistance movement against Iberian occupation of coastal cities. Their military and political strength grew, leading to the capture of Marrakesh in 1525 CE and Fez in 1554 CE, establishing their state. A decisive victory over Portugal at the Battle of Wadi al-Makhazin (Battle of the Three Kings) in 1578 CE restored Morocco's prestige and brought economic benefits from African trade. The Saadian state declined after the death of Sultan Al-Mansour al-Dhahabi in 1603 CE due to internal power struggles.  
* **Alaouite Dynasty (1667-Present):** The current ruling family of Morocco, the Alaouites, trace their lineage to Ali ibn Abi Talib. They established a unified state under Moulay al-Rashid (1664-1672) and Moulay Ismail (1672-1727), who created the 'Abid al-Bukhari army and expelled the English from Tangier (1684) and the Spanish from Larache (1689). After Moulay Ismail's death, Morocco faced fragmentation, which was later reunified by Muhammad III (1757-1790), who also famously made Morocco one of the first countries to recognize the independence of the United States in 1777\. Succeeding rulers, including Muhammad IV and Hassan I, strengthened trade, modernized the army and administration, and navigated complex relations with European powers.

### **European Influence and Modern Era (1830-Present)**

The 19th and 20th centuries were marked by increasing European intervention, leading to colonial rule and eventual independence.

* **Growing European Influence (19th Century):** France developed a significant interest in Morocco after 1830\. The French-Moroccan War in 1844, involving the bombing of Tangier and Essaouira, weakened Morocco, leading Sultan Abd al-Rahman to sign a trade treaty with Britain in 1856\. The Spanish-Moroccan War (1859-1860) further strained Morocco's finances. European powers increased their presence and economic privileges, despite Sultan Hassan I's efforts at the Madrid Conference in 1880 to assert Moroccan sovereignty. German efforts to counter French influence led to the First Moroccan Crisis (1905-1906) and the Agadir Crisis (1911).  
* **French and Spanish Protectorate (1912-1956):** The Treaty of Fez, signed on March 30, 1912, officially made Morocco a French Protectorate. A second treaty on November 27, 1912, granted Spain zones of influence in northern (Rif) and southern (Ifni, Tarfaya, Western Sahara) Morocco. Tangier gained special status as an international zone through the Tangier Convention (1923) and Paris Agreement (1925). This period saw the **Rif War (1920-1927)** led by Muhammad Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi, who established the Rif Republic.  
* **Path to Independence:** The nationalist movement grew, supported by the Arab League and the United States, and notably by Sultan Muhammad V. Muhammad V, who ascended the throne in 1927 at age 18, became a central figure in the struggle for independence. The **Tangier Speech in April 1947** escalated resistance. In 1953, Muhammad V and the royal family were exiled by France, sparking the "Revolution of the King and the People". Their return in 1955 paved the way for independence.  
* **Independent Morocco (1956-Present):**  
  * **Muhammad V's Reign (1956-1961):** French recognition of Morocco's independence came on March 2, 1956, followed by Spanish recognition on April 7, 1956, leading to the reintegration of northern territories. Morocco also regained Tarfaya from Spanish occupation in 1958, and the international status of Tangier was abolished. Muhammad V passed away in 1961\.  
  * **Hassan II's Reign (1961-1999):** Hassan II ascended the throne in 1961, and Morocco adopted its first constitutional monarchy in 1962\. Significant events included the regaining of Sidi Ifni in 1969, and the **Green March on November 6, 1975**, where 350,000 volunteers marched into the Moroccan Sahara, followed by the Madrid Accords on November 14, 1975, which led to Morocco regaining its Saharan provinces. Mauritania later relinquished its share of the Sahara to Morocco in 1979\. Hassan II chaired the Al-Quds Committee from 1979 until his death in 1999\. The Union of Arab Maghreb was founded in Marrakesh in 1989\. A ceasefire between the Moroccan army and the Polisario Front came into effect in 1991 under UN sponsorship. Hassan II passed away on July 23, 1999\.  
  * **Muhammad VI's Reign (1999-Present):** Muhammad VI ascended the throne in 1999\. He initiated reforms, including the release of political prisoners and sentence reductions, and the establishment of a committee to compensate victims of arbitrary detention. Key developments include the adoption of Amazigh language education in primary schools in 2003 and the establishment of the Royal Institute for Amazigh Culture in 2001, following the Agadir Speech where the King affirmed Amazigh as a core component of Moroccan culture. In response to women's rights protests, a new family code (Moudawana) was adopted in 2004\. Morocco has maintained strong international relations, condemning the 9/11 attacks and becoming a major non-NATO ally of the United States in 2004\. The US-Morocco Free Trade Agreement came into effect in 2006\. A referendum on a new constitution was held on July 1, 2011\.

The history of Morocco is a rich tapestry woven through centuries of successive dynasties, each leaving its distinct mark on the nation's political, cultural, and architectural landscape. These dynasties, including the Idrisids, Almoravids, Almohads, Marinids, Saadians, and Alaouites, have stories ranging from founders fleeing persecution to reformist movements evolving into powerful states, ultimately shaping the Morocco recognized today. This historical journey has seen periods of architectural and civilizational flourishing, scientific advancement, and prosperity, alongside destruction, wars, and times of decline and poverty. The policies and challenges faced by these rulers often present striking similarities across different eras, influencing how the Moroccan populace has interacted with and shown loyalty to its governing families.

### **Pre-Islamic and Early Islamic Periods**

Morocco's human history stretches back approximately 400,000 years, with evidence of various civilizations interacting and developing. Early periods include the Acheulean, Mousterian, Aterian, Iberomaurusian, and Capsian cultures. The **Phoenicians** settled the Moroccan coast between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE, ruling over indigenous Amazigh (Berber) inhabitants who had been present for two millennia prior. **Carthage** later dominated the coastal region from the 5th century BCE. Eventually, the **Kingdom of Mauretania** emerged as the first political entity ruled by local kings in ancient Morocco, before its conquest by the Romans in 44 CE. This Roman period was followed by brief independence under the Amazigh Christian Baquates, then successive invasions by the Vandals and Byzantines, until the **Islamic conquest** of Morocco and North Africa by the Umayyad Caliphate in the 8th century CE. However, Morocco quickly detached from Umayyad control after the Berber Revolt led by Maysara al-Matghari in 740 CE, which paved the way for the establishment of independent Amazigh Muslim emirates such as Burghwata, Nekor, and Banu Midrar. The true Islamic state in Morocco, in the sense of a centralized government, was not established until 788 CE with the **Idrisid dynasty**.

### **Idrisid Dynasty (788-974 CE)**

The **Idrisid dynasty** originated from the Battle of Fakh near Mecca in 786 CE, where **Idris ibn Abdallah al-Hasan**, a descendant of Ali ibn Abi Talib, narrowly escaped Abbasid persecution. Fleeing with his Amazigh servant Rashid, Idris reached Egypt, then traversed through Barqa, Tlemcen, the lower Sous, and Tangier before settling in **Volubilis**. There, Rashid contacted Ishaq ibn Muhammad ibn Abd al-Hamid, the influential leader of the **Awraba Amazigh tribe**, who welcomed Idris. Recognizing his lineage to the Household of the Prophet, the Awraba tribe pledged allegiance to Idris as their caliph on February 15, 788 CE. Idris I subsequently invited surrounding tribes to join his rule, establishing himself as their emir. His primary goal became the spread of Islam among tribes still adhering to Zoroastrianism, Judaism, or Christianity. He led a large army to conquer Chellah (near Rabat), Tamesna, and Tadla, extending his campaigns to mountain tribes and securing Ceuta, where he built its mosque.

Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid was alarmed by Idris's success, particularly his ability to rally Amazigh tribes. Historical accounts vary on Idris I's death; some state he was assassinated by a poisoned perfume sent by al-Rashid in 793 CE, while others suggest he died naturally. After his death, his servant Rashid became regent for Idris II, who was still in his mother's womb. Rashid was later mysteriously killed, and Idris II was raised by another Amazigh elder, Abu Khalid Yazid ibn Elias al-Abdi. **Idris II** took power in 808 CE (192 AH) and brought the state to its peak. He was instrumental in structuring and organizing the nascent state by introducing new institutions like the vizierate, secretariat, judiciary, and imamate. He further developed **Fez**, his father's nascent foundation, and made it the state capital, intentionally opening it to immigrants from Kairouan and al-Andalus to dilute tribal influences and foster a new civilization. This led to Fez becoming a center of cultural, scientific, and religious enlightenment, and the Idrisid state became the most significant political entity in the Maghreb al-Aqsa.

Upon Idris II's death in 828 CE, he left many sons, and his eldest, **Muhammad**, divided the kingdom among them as a family inheritance, resulting in several semi-autonomous regional emirates. This division led to internal conflicts, often triggered by Muhammad's decision to revoke the governors' right to mint coins. However, the populace under Idrisid rule largely remained stable, showing no major revolts. Historians attribute this stability to the **deep reverence and sanctity** accorded to the Idrisid family due to their lineage to the Prophet's Household, combined with their integration into Moroccan society through marriage and local customs, ensuring they were not seen as foreign rulers. This popular respect for the *shurafa* (descendants of the Prophet) evolved into a political principle that endures to this day.

Later Idrisid rulers in Fez, such as Ali ibn Muhammad and Yahya ibn Muhammad, saw periods of peace and prosperity, with extensive construction in Fez, including the expansion of the Al-Andalus and Al-Qarawiyyin Mosques. However, the dynasty faced a major external threat from the **Fatimids** of Ifriqiya in the late 9th century. Masala ibn Habbus al-Miknasi, the Fatimid governor, defeated Idrisid emir Yahya near Meknes, forcing him to become a Fatimid vassal. Masala's cousin, Musa ibn Abi al-Afiyah, then systematically worked to destroy Idrisid power, imprisoning and exiling Yahya, who eventually died of starvation. Musa seized Idrisid lands in northern Morocco, forcing the remaining Idrisids into the stronghold of Hajar al-Nisr in the Rif Mountains. The Idrisids became caught between the rival Fatimid and Umayyad Caliphates. The last Idrisid ruler, **Al-Hasan ibn Kannun**, shifted allegiances multiple times before being captured by the Umayyads and exiled to Egypt. He was later assassinated while attempting to reclaim Morocco with Fatimid support in 985 CE. The Idrisid dynasty's rule ended after approximately 130 years, but their descendants continued to exist through various families, and their legacy lies in establishing the first independent Islamic state in Morocco and fostering a sense of national identity centered around *sharifian* sanctity.

### **Almoravid Dynasty (1060-1147 CE)**

The **Almoravids**, also known as the "Veiled People" (*al-Mulaththamūn*) due to their custom of veiling their faces, emerged as a powerful dynasty after the Idrisids. Their story began as a reformist Islamic movement in the 11th century, spreading its influence to West Africa. The movement was initiated by **Sheikh Abdallah ibn Yasin**, a scholar sent by Kairouan's jurists at the request of Yahya ibn Ibrahim, chief of the Juddala tribe in southern Mauritania, to teach proper Islamic principles to a population described as having strayed from religion. After initial rejection, Ibn Yasin retreated to the Sahara, where he established a simple camp. Slowly, followers gathered, initially five, then increasing to a thousand within four years, forming a disciplined community known as the **Almoravids** (from *ribat*, a fortified monastery or military outpost and commitment to jihad). Their mission was to invite the Sanhaja tribes to their movement.

The movement gained significant military strength when **Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni**, chief of the Lamtuna tribe, and later his successor **Abu Bakr ibn Umar al-Lamtuni**, joined with their entire tribe. After Abdallah ibn Yasin's death in 1059 CE, Abu Bakr ibn Umar assumed leadership of the 12,000 Almoravid mujahideen, transforming the movement into the **Almoravid state**. This state expanded rapidly, conquering vast territories from the Atlantic in the west to the Senegal River basin in the south, and eastward towards the Chad basin, while also extending north into the Atlas Mountains and across the Mediterranean into parts of the Iberian Peninsula (al-Andalus). Their empire eventually encompassed over eighteen African countries, including Guinea, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Gabon, as well as Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania. Abu Bakr al-Lamtuni initiated this expansion before his death in 1087 CE.

**Yusuf ibn Tashfin** is considered the ruler of the Almoravid's golden age. He founded **Marrakesh** in 1070 CE, which became the dynasty's capital and a major political and cultural center of the Islamic West. The Almoravids constructed numerous religious sites, including mosques like the Koutoubia Mosque, as well as Quranic schools, city walls, and palaces. Moroccans treated the Almoravids with a similar reverence and sanctity as they did the Idrisids.

### **Almohad Dynasty (1145-1248 CE)**

The **Almohads** rose to power under the leadership of **Ibn Tumart**, who presented himself as the "awaited Mahdi" and "infallible Imam," adopting a legal methodology based on direct study of the Qur'an and Sunnah, rather than the prevailing Maliki jurisprudence in Morocco. During his travels, Ibn Tumart preached reform, adherence to Islamic law, and fighting against innovations and immorality, gathering many followers. He met **Abd al-Mu'min Ali al-Kumi**, who became a key figure in the movement. Ibn Tumart established his base in Tinmel and began organizing his followers, dividing his movement into a state-like structure with a ruling council. In March 1122, Ibn Tumart declared his leadership and amassed a large army to overthrow the Almoravids.

After the death of Almoravid Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf in 1142 CE, his successor Tashfin was unable to resist the Almohad army led by Abd al-Mu'min, who captured Tlemcen in 1144 CE. Moroccan cities steadily fell to the Almohads until Marrakesh was conquered on March 24, 1147 CE, where Isaac ibn Ali, the last Almoravid emir, was killed. **Abd al-Mu'min al-Kumi** assumed the title of Caliph and established the **Almohad state**, which then expanded to control vast areas of al-Andalus and all of the Maghreb. Abd al-Mu'min died in 1163 CE.

The Almohad state reached its peak under **Yusuf ibn Abd al-Mu'min** and especially **Yacoub al-Mansour**, who fostered scientific and cultural development. In 1195 CE, the Almohads decisively defeated the Christian kings in the **Battle of Alarcos**. However, under Sultan **Al-Nasir** (who began ruling in 1199 CE), a truce with King Alfonso VIII of Castile was exploited by Alfonso to strengthen his forces and allies. This led to a devastating defeat for the Muslims at the **Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa** (also known as the Battle of al-Hisn al-Iqab) in 1212 CE, after which Muslim power in al-Andalus never recovered. The Almohad state began to collapse rapidly after 1213 CE, with al-Andalus falling after 1228 CE, Tunis to the Hafsids, and Algeria to the Banu Abd al-Wad. From 1244 CE, the Almohads faced campaigns from the Marinids, losing control of Morocco and eventually being completely overthrown by them in 1269 CE.

### **Marinid Dynasty (1244-1465 CE)**

The **Marinids** were a particularly intriguing dynasty, as they did not base their rule on religious sanctity but on tribal principles of obedience. Descending from the Zenata Berber tribe of Banu Marin, they were initially nomadic bedouins. Their opportunity arose with the Almohad defeat at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1213 CE, which signaled the fragmentation of central Almohad authority, coupled with plague and insecurity. The Marinids exploited this weakness, launching successive attacks to expand their territory in the Rif and Gharb regions. Recognizing that Moroccans were accustomed to religiously sanctioned rule, the Marinids initially placed themselves under the nominal authority of the Hafsids.

In 1269 CE, after several wars, the Marinids defeated the Almohads in Marrakesh and established their rule. However, they chose **Fez** as their capital. Their first sultan, **Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd al-Haqq**, declared independence from the Hafsids and unified Morocco, incorporating Arab tribes to fight against separatist regions. The Marinid state expanded significantly under later sultans like Abu Said I and **Abu al-Hasan al-Marini**, who unified the Greater Maghreb under his banner, controlling lands from the Sous and Sahara in the south to Misrata in the east, and Ronda in al-Andalus in the north. To legitimize their rule, the Marinids sent armies into al-Andalus four times to support the Banu al-Ahmar, fighting fierce wars against the Spanish and conquering cities like Algeciras, Tarifa, Malaga, Ghomara, and Ronda, though many were later ceded by Sultan Yusuf ibn Yaqub.

Internally, the Marinids differed from previous dynasties by basing their rule on their numerical strength and allied Amazigh and Arab tribal organizations, forming the basis of the **Makhzen** (state administration). They allowed freedom of belief and religious schools, leading to the resurgence of the Maliki *madhhab* (school of thought) that the Almohads had suppressed. They revered and honored the Idrisid *shurafa*, rebuilding the shrine of Moulay Idris and reviving celebrations of the Prophet's birthday. The Marinids also welcomed **Andalusian Jews**, who fled al-Andalus. Their era saw significant urban and cultural development, with the construction of new cities like **Fez al-Jadid**, Tetouan, and Mansoura in Morocco, and al-Bunayya in al-Andalus. They built madrasas (religious schools), hospitals, mosques, *ribats*, and endowments. Their administration introduced new military and administrative roles, such as the *mashyakhat al-ghuzat* (leadership of raiders). Fez became a hub for scholars, historians, and literary figures like Ibn Battuta, Ibn al-Khatib, Ibn Khaldun, and Ibn al-Banna al-Marrakushi. The Marinid state left a lasting architectural and civilizational legacy, including palaces, fortresses, schools, mosques, and *zawiyas*.

The decline of the Marinid state began after the Portuguese capture of Ceuta in 1415 CE. This marked an era of collapse due to wars with neighbors, internal strife, power struggles, and continuous clashes with the Kingdom of Granada, compounded by the Marinids' lack of a large fleet and the general imbalance in the Mediterranean. The Marinids were finally defeated by the Portuguese in 1465 CE, bringing an end to their rule and solidifying Morocco's contemporary borders.

### **Wattasid Dynasty (1472-1554 CE)**

Following the Marinids, the **Wattasids**, another branch of the Zenata Amazigh tribe, governed Morocco. They had long served as viziers alongside their Marinid cousins before participating in their overthrow. Although most Wattasid leaders were massacred by the Marinids, two brothers survived, one of whom, **Muhammad al-Sheikh al-Mahdi**, seized power and entered Fez in 1472 CE. Upon his arrival, Portuguese invasions targeted Asilah and other Moroccan coastal areas. Successive Wattasid sultans struggled to lead military campaigns against the Portuguese while simultaneously quelling small emirates that capitalized on the weakened central authority. They failed to recognize the true threat posed by the **Saadians**, who launched campaigns from the Sahara. The last Wattasid sultan was overthrown and killed by the Saadians in 1545 CE, marking the beginning of Saadian rule.

### **Saadian Dynasty (1510/1525-1659 CE)**

The **Saadian dynasty** reinstated the principle of rule through sacred lineage, tracing their descent to the Prophet Muhammad's Household, specifically to Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyyah, who was related to Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib. Some sources trace their lineage to Banu Saad ibn Bakr, Halimah al-Saadiyyah (the Prophet's wet nurse), hence the name "Saadians". Historians generally agree on their descent from the Prophet's Household in Yanbu, Hijaz. Their ancestors migrated from Yanbu to the Draa River valley in the Sous region of southern Morocco in the early 14th century, where they began spreading their call through Sufi orders. Many Moroccans saw **Muhammad al-Qaim bi-Amr Allah al-Saadi** as the leader who could rally them against the Portuguese and Spanish, and he was pledged allegiance in 1510 CE.

The Saadian rule began by mobilizing allied tribes to conquer Taroudant and its fortress, initiating battles against the Spanish and Portuguese who were exploiting the weakened Wattasid state. Muhammad al-Saadi also sent his three sons to travel the country, inviting people to the new state and recruiting fighters. The Saadians definitively ended the Portuguese presence on their lands in 1578 CE, following their victory in the **Battle of Wadi al-Makhazin** (also known as the Battle of Ksar el-Kebir or the Battle of the Three Kings). This battle, initiated by King Sebastian of Portugal, saw the deaths of three monarchs: the deposed Moroccan King Muhammad al-Mutawakkil, the ruling Moroccan King Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik, and King Sebastian. **Ahmad al-Mansour** inherited the Saadian throne in Fez after this decisive victory, which established Saadian political and military dominance across Morocco and the southern Mediterranean. Portugal lost its sovereignty and monarchy, while Morocco experienced stability, prosperity, and a flourishing of knowledge.

However, the Saadian state, despite its strong and rapid rise, also experienced a "resounding fall". Intense disputes within the ruling family and unrest in the country followed the succession of Abu Maali Zidan after the death of Ahmad al-Mansour al-Dhahabi. Conflicts continued among his sons, leading to the assassination of Abd al-Malik in Marrakesh by his brother al-Walid. The state fragmented, with revolts and separatist movements emerging, and independent emirates proliferated. The Sultan's authority barely extended beyond Marrakesh. The Saadians remained in Marrakesh until their state collapsed with the assassination of the last Saadian sultan in Marrakesh in 1659 CE.

### **Alaouite Dynasty (1666-Present)**

The **Alaouite dynasty**, like the Saadians, traces its origins to the Prophet Muhammad's Household. This family was known in the 13th century and beyond as the *Sharifian Sijilmasiyyin*, after the city of Sijilmasa (founded in 757 CE), which was the base of the Tafilalt region before it shifted to Rissani. According to historical texts, the ancestor of the Alaouites, **Hasan ibn al-Qasim**, known as Hasan al-Dakhil, settled in Sijilmasa in 1165 CE and died there in 1277 CE. He came to Morocco at the request of Sijilmasi pilgrims who desired a descendant of the Prophet's Household among them for blessings.

In the early 16th century, Morocco was deeply divided into regional political entities. In 1631 CE, **Sharif ibn Ali ibn Muhammad** emerged in the Tafilalt region, and the Alaouite dynasty began its ascent to power in the 17th century, with Sharif ibn Ali declared Sultan of Tafilalt. His goal was to establish the Alaouite state across Morocco. During the reign of **Muhammad I** (1671-1674 CE), challenges from movements seeking revenge for the Saadians were overcome, ending the era of small, feuding political entities. His son, **Al-Rashid** (1672-1674 CE), unified and pacified the country after a long period of division. He was succeeded by his brother, **Moulay Ismail**, whose reign (1672-1727 CE) was one of the longest in Moroccan history, characterized by strong centralized rule. Moulay Ismail reunified Morocco completely, extending its territory from the Mediterranean coast in the north to the Senegal River in the south.

The Alaouites unified Morocco and maintained state sovereignty by suppressing separatist conflicts and revolts, largely due to their religious and social standing, and the establishment of the **'Abid al-Bukhari army**. This elite military force, named for the oath of loyalty taken on Imam al-Bukhari's book, was initially formed from 2,000 soldiers to fight Moulay al-Rashid. Moulay Ismail significantly expanded this army by recruiting "slaves" from cities and rural areas and bringing soldiers from Sudan, integrating them with various tribes and cities. The 'Abid al-Bukhari's primary duties included tax collection, securing trade routes, and protecting the Alaouite state from rebels and enemies.

After Moulay Ismail's death, internal disputes among his sons nearly led to chaos, but the deep reverence of Moroccans for the Alaouite family prevented major revolts. Order was re-established during the reign of **Muhammad ibn Abdallah** in the latter half of the 18th century. The 19th century saw increasing European influence. Although the Alaouites ruled as absolute sultans until 1912, the Spanish and French protectorates reduced them to symbolic monarchs. With independence in 1956, **Mohammed V**, who had supported the nationalist cause, resumed the Alaouite role in independent state leadership. Shortly after, Mohammed V adopted the title of King instead of Sultan, a title maintained by his successors, **Hassan II** and **Mohammed VI**.

Since their ascension, the Alaouites have preserved the country's unity. They initially established Fez as their capital, which was later moved to Meknes under Moulay Ismail, and finally to **Rabat**, the current capital of Morocco since 1912\. Through this dynasty, the divisions that characterized Morocco during the decline of previous ruling families since the Islamic conquest were brought to an end.

This document provides a comprehensive list of rulers in Morocco from the Islamic conquest to the modern state. Historically, Moroccan rulers were referred to as **Sultans**, a title that transitioned to **King** following independence in 1956\.
