Morocco's rich history spans over a thousand years, shaped by a succession of influential dynasties that have left indelible marks on its political, cultural, artistic, and architectural identity. From origins rooted in antiquity, through the arrival of Islam, to the establishment of powerful empires, each ruling family contributed uniquely to the nation's development, enduring periods of prosperity, conflict, and transformation.

### **Pre-Islamic and Early Islamic Periods**

Morocco's human history dates back approximately 400,000 years, with evidence of early human civilizations such as the Acheulean, Mousterian, Aterian, Iberomaurusian, and Capsian cultures. Recorded history began with the **Phoenicians**, who settled the Moroccan coast between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE, followed by **Carthage's** dominance from the 5th century BCE. The **Kingdom of Mauretania** emerged as the first local political entity before it was conquered by the **Romans** in 44 CE. After a period of independence under Amazigh Christian Baquates, and subsequent invasions by the Vandals and Byzantines, the **Islamic conquest** arrived in the 8th century CE. However, Morocco quickly detached from Umayyad control following the **Berber Revolt** led by Maysara al-Matghari in 740 CE, leading to the formation of independent Amazigh Muslim emirates like Burghwata, Nekor, and Banu Midrar. The first true Islamic state, in the sense of a centralized government, was established in 788 CE with the **Idrisid dynasty**.

### **Idrisid Dynasty (788-974 CE)**

The **Idrisid dynasty** was founded by **Idris ibn Abdallah al-Hasan (Idris I)**, a descendant of Ali ibn Abi Talib, who fled Abbasid persecution after the Battle of Fakh near Mecca in 786 CE. He found refuge in Volubilis (near modern Meknes), where the influential Amazigh Awraba tribe pledged allegiance to him as their caliph in February 788 CE. Idris I then expanded his rule, conquering regions like Chellah, Tamesna, Tadla, and Ceuta, aiming to spread Islam among local tribes. His success alarmed the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid, and historical accounts suggest Idris I was either assassinated by poison in 793 CE or died naturally.

After Idris I's death, his son **Idris II**, born to his Amazigh wife Kenza, assumed power in 808 CE. He brought the state to its peak, structuring and organizing the nascent government by establishing new institutions such as the vizierate, secretariat, judiciary, and imamate. Idris II developed **Fez**, his father's foundation, and made it the state capital, attracting immigrants from Kairouan and al-Andalus to foster a new civilization and dilute tribal influences. The Idrisid state became the most significant political entity in the Maghreb al-Aqsa.

Upon Idris II's death in 828 CE, his eldest son, **Muhammad**, divided the kingdom among his brothers as a family inheritance, leading to the emergence of several semi-autonomous regional emirates and internal conflicts. However, the Moroccan populace largely maintained political stability and did not revolt against the Idrisid princes. Historians attribute this to the **deep reverence and sanctity** accorded to the Idrisid family due to their lineage to the Prophet's Household, combined with their integration into Moroccan society through marriage and local customs, ensuring they were not seen as foreign rulers. This popular respect for the *shurafa* (descendants of the Prophet) evolved into a political principle that endures to this day. Later Idrisid rulers like Ali ibn Muhammad and Yahya ibn Muhammad oversaw periods of peace and extensive construction in Fez, including the expansion of the Al-Andalus and Al-Qarawiyyin Mosques.

The dynasty faced a major external threat from the **Fatimids** of Ifriqiya in the late 9th century, with their general Masala ibn Habbus al-Miknasi defeating Idrisid emir Yahya near Meknes and forcing him into vassalage. Masala's cousin, Musa ibn Abi al-Afiyah, systematically dismantled Idrisid power, forcing them to retreat to the stronghold of Hajar al-Nisr in the Rif Mountains. Caught between the rival Fatimid and Umayyad Caliphates, the last Idrisid ruler, **Al-Hasan ibn Kannun**, shifted allegiances multiple times before being captured and eventually assassinated in 985 CE. Although their formal rule ended after approximately 130 years, their descendants continued to exist through various families, and their legacy lies in establishing the first independent Islamic state in Morocco and fostering a sense of national identity centered around *sharifian* sanctity.

### **Almoravid Dynasty (1060-1147 CE)**

The **Almoravids**, also known as the "Veiled People" (*al-Mulaththamūn*) from the Sanhaja Berber tribes, emerged as a powerful dynasty after the Idrisids. Their movement began as a reformist Islamic call in the 11th century, initiated by **Sheikh Abdallah ibn Yasin**, a scholar sent to the Juddala tribe in southern Mauritania to teach proper Islamic principles. After initial rejection, Ibn Yasin established a *ribat* (fortified monastery/military outpost) in the Sahara, where he gathered followers, forming a disciplined community committed to jihad. The movement gained significant military strength when **Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni** and later **Abu Bakr ibn Umar al-Lamtuni**, chiefs of the Lamtuna tribe, joined with their entire tribe.

After Abdallah ibn Yasin's death in 1059 CE, Abu Bakr ibn Umar transformed the movement into the **Almoravid state**, expanding rapidly across vast territories. **Yusuf ibn Tashfin** is credited as the ruler of the Almoravid's golden age. He founded **Marrakesh** in 1070 CE, establishing it as the dynasty's capital and a major political and cultural center of the Islamic West. The Almoravids unified all of present-day Morocco, parts of western Algeria, and Al-Andalus, creating the first unified Moroccan state that stretched from north to south. They constructed numerous religious sites, including mosques like the Koutoubia Mosque, Quranic schools, city walls, and palaces. Moroccans treated the Almoravids with similar reverence and sanctity as the Idrisids.

### **Almohad Dynasty (1145-1248 CE)**

The **Almohads** rose to power under **Ibn Tumart**, who proclaimed himself the "awaited Mahdi" and "infallible Imam". He preached reform, strict adherence to Islamic law, and fighting against innovations, gathering many followers, including **Abd al-Mu'min Ali al-Kumi**, who became a key figure. Ibn Tumart established his base in Tinmel and organized his movement with a state-like structure. In March 1122, Ibn Tumart declared his leadership and amassed an army to overthrow the Almoravids.

After the death of Almoravid Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf in 1142 CE, his successor Tashfin was unable to resist the Almohad army. Under Abd al-Mu'min, the Almohads captured Tlemcen in 1144 CE and steadily conquered Moroccan cities until Marrakesh fell on March 24, 1147 CE, ending Almoravid rule. **Abd al-Mu'min al-Kumi** assumed the title of Caliph and established the **Almohad state**, expanding its control across vast areas of al-Andalus and all of the Maghreb. The Almohad state reached its peak under **Yusuf ibn Abd al-Mu'min** and particularly **Yacoub al-Mansour**, who fostered scientific and cultural development. In 1195 CE, the Almohads decisively defeated Christian kings in the **Battle of Alarcos** (also known as the Battle of al-Hisn al-Iqab). However, under Sultan **Al-Nasir**, a devastating defeat against a massive Christian coalition at the **Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa** in 1212 CE severely weakened Muslim power in al-Andalus. The Almohad state rapidly collapsed after 1213 CE, losing al-Andalus, Tunis to the Hafsids, and Algeria to the Banu Abd al-Wad. They were eventually completely overthrown by the Marinids in 1269 CE.

### **Marinid Dynasty (1244-1465 CE)**

The **Marinids**, a Zenata Berber tribe, emerged as a significant dynasty after the Almohad defeat at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1213 CE, exploiting the fragmentation of central authority, plague, and insecurity. Unlike previous dynasties, the Marinids did not base their rule on religious sanctity but on tribal principles of obedience. Initially nomadic, they advanced into the Rif and Gharb regions, launching successive attacks to expand their territory. They understood that Moroccans were accustomed to religiously sanctioned rule, so they initially placed themselves under the nominal authority of the Hafsids for legitimacy.

In 1269 CE, after several wars, the Marinids defeated the Almohads in Marrakesh, but chose **Fez** as their capital. Their first sultan, **Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd al-Haqq**, declared independence from the Hafsids and unified Morocco, incorporating Arab tribes to fight against separatist regions. The Marinid state expanded significantly under sultans like Abu Said I and **Abu al-Hasan al-Marini**, who unified the Greater Maghreb under his banner, controlling lands from the Sous and Sahara in the south to Misrata in the east, and Ronda in al-Andalus in the north. To confirm their role as acceptable Islamic rulers, the Marinids sent armies into al-Andalus four times to support the Banu al-Ahmar against the Spanish, conquering cities like Algeciras, Tarifa, Malaga, Ghomara, and Ronda, though many were later ceded.

Internally, the Marinids based their rule on their numerical strength and allied Amazigh and Arab tribal organizations, forming the basis of the **Makhzen** (state administration). They allowed freedom of belief and religious schools, leading to the resurgence of the Maliki *madhhab* that the Almohads had suppressed. They revered the Idrisid *shurafa*, rebuilding the shrine of Moulay Idris and reviving celebrations of the Prophet's birthday. The Marinids also welcomed **Andalusian Jews** who fled al-Andalus. Their era saw significant urban and cultural development, with the construction of new cities like **Fez al-Jadid**, Tetouan, and Mansoura, and the building of madrasas, hospitals, mosques, and *ribats*. Fez became a hub for scholars, historians, and literary figures like Ibn Battuta, Ibn al-Khatib, Ibn Khaldun, and Ibn al-Banna al-Marrakushi.

The decline of the Marinid state began after the Portuguese capture of Ceuta in 1415 CE, marked by wars with neighbors, internal strife, power struggles, continuous clashes with Granada, and a lack of a large fleet. The Marinids were finally defeated by the Portuguese in 1465 CE, bringing an end to their rule and solidifying Morocco's contemporary borders.

### **Wattasid Dynasty (1472-1554 CE)**

Following the Marinids, the **Wattasids**, another branch of the Zenata Amazigh tribe, came to power, having previously served as viziers. Although most Wattasid leaders were massacred by the Marinids, **Muhammad al-Sheikh al-Mahdi** seized power and entered Fez in 1472 CE. Upon his arrival, Portuguese invasions targeted Asilah and other Moroccan coastal areas. Successive Wattasid sultans struggled to lead military campaigns against the Portuguese while simultaneously quelling small emirates that capitalized on the weakened central authority. They failed to recognize the true threat posed by the **Saadians**, who began launching campaigns from the Sahara. The last Wattasid sultan was overthrown and killed by the Saadians in 1545 CE, marking the beginning of Saadian rule.

### **Saadian Dynasty (1510/1525-1659 CE)**

The **Saadian dynasty** reinstated the principle of rule through sacred lineage, tracing their descent to the Prophet Muhammad's Household. Their ancestors migrated from Yanbu, Hijaz, to the Draa River valley in the Sous region of southern Morocco in the early 14th century, where they began spreading their call through Sufi orders. Many Moroccans saw **Muhammad al-Qaim bi-Amr Allah al-Saadi** as the leader who could rally them against the Portuguese and Spanish, and he was pledged allegiance in 1510 CE.

The Saadian rule began by mobilizing allied tribes to conquer Taroudant and its fortress, initiating battles against the Spanish and Portuguese who were exploiting the weakened Wattasid state. Muhammad al-Saadi also sent his three sons to travel the country, inviting people to the new state and recruiting fighters. The Saadians definitively ended the Portuguese presence on their lands in 1578 CE, following their victory in the **Battle of Wadi al-Makhazin** (also known as the Battle of Ksar el-Kebir or the Battle of the Three Kings). This battle, initiated by King Sebastian of Portugal, saw the deaths of three monarchs: the deposed Moroccan King Muhammad al-Mutawakkil, the ruling Moroccan King Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik, and King Sebastian. **Ahmad al-Mansour** inherited the Saadian throne in Fez after this decisive victory, which established Saadian political and military dominance across Morocco and the southern Mediterranean. Portugal lost its sovereignty, while Morocco experienced stability, prosperity, and a flourishing of knowledge.

However, the Saadian state, despite its strong and rapid rise, also experienced a "resounding fall". Intense disputes within the ruling family and unrest in the country followed the succession of Abu Maali Zidan after the death of Ahmad al-Mansour al-Dhahabi. Conflicts continued among his sons, leading to the assassination of Abd al-Malik in Marrakesh by his brother al-Walid. The state fragmented, with revolts and separatist movements emerging, and independent emirates proliferated. The Sultan's authority barely extended beyond Marrakesh. The Saadians remained in Marrakesh until their state collapsed with the assassination of the last Saadian sultan in Marrakesh in 1659 CE.

### **Alaouite Dynasty (1666-Present)**

The **Alaouite dynasty**, like the Saadians, traces its origins to the Prophet Muhammad's Household. This family, known as the *Sharifian Sijilmasiyyin*, was based in Sijilmasa (founded in 757 CE) in the Tafilalt region. The Alaouite ancestor, **Hasan ibn al-Qasim**, known as Hasan al-Dakhil, settled in Sijilmasa in 1165 CE.

In the early 16th century, Morocco was deeply divided into regional political entities. In 1631 CE, **Sharif ibn Ali ibn Muhammad** emerged in the Tafilalt region, and the Alaouite dynasty began its ascent to power in the 17th century, with Sharif ibn Ali declared Sultan of Tafilalt. His goal was to establish the Alaouite state across Morocco. During the reign of **Muhammad I** (1671-1674 CE), challenges from movements seeking revenge for the Saadians were overcome, ending the era of small, feuding political entities. His son, **Al-Rashid** (1672-1674 CE), unified and pacified the country after a long period of division. He was succeeded by his brother, **Moulay Ismail**, whose reign (1672-1727 CE) was one of the longest in Moroccan history, characterized by strong centralized rule. Moulay Ismail reunified Morocco completely, extending its territory from the Mediterranean coast in the north to the Senegal River in the south.

The Alaouites unified Morocco and maintained state sovereignty by suppressing separatist conflicts and revolts, largely due to their religious and social standing, and the establishment of the **'Abid al-Bukhari army**. This elite military force, named for the oath of loyalty taken on Imam al-Bukhari's book, was initially formed from 2,000 soldiers to fight Moulay al-Rashid. Moulay Ismail significantly expanded this army by recruiting from cities and rural areas and bringing soldiers from Sudan, integrating them with various tribes and cities. The 'Abid al-Bukhari's primary duties included tax collection, securing trade routes, and protecting the Alaouite state from rebels and enemies.

After Moulay Ismail's death, internal disputes among his sons nearly led to chaos, but the deep reverence of Moroccans for the Alaouite family prevented major revolts. Order was re-established during the reign of **Muhammad ibn Abdallah** in the latter half of the 18th century. The 19th century saw increasing European influence. Although the Alaouites ruled as absolute sultans until 1912, the Spanish and French protectorates reduced them to symbolic monarchs. With independence in 1956, **Mohammed V**, who had supported the nationalist cause, resumed the Alaouite role in independent state leadership. Shortly after, Mohammed V adopted the title of King instead of Sultan, a title maintained by his successors, **Hassan II** and **Mohammed VI**.

Since their ascension, the Alaouites have preserved the country's unity. They initially established Fez as their capital, which was later moved to Meknes under Moulay Ismail, and finally to **Rabat**, the current capital of Morocco since 1912\. Through this dynasty, the divisions that characterized Morocco during the decline of previous ruling families since the Islamic conquest were brought to an end.

The highest-ranking Portuguese official in Mazagão (El Jadida) in 1552 was Álvaro Pires de Carvalho, titled Capitão-Mor (Captain-Major).

Actually, there wasn’t a Portuguese official in Azemmour or Safi in 1552, because by that year the Portuguese had already abandoned both places. 

Here’s the timeline:

Safi (Safim) was under Portuguese control from 1508 until October 1541, when it was evacuated. 

Azemmour (Azamor) was held by the Portuguese from 1513 until October 1541 as well.

So in 1552, neither was under Portuguese administration, and thus there was no Portuguese captain, governor, or highest-ranking Portuguese official in those fortresses in that year.

## The Emirate of Nekor (c. 710–1080 CE): A Comprehensive Chronology and Socio-Political Analysis of the Banu Salih Dynasty in the Moroccan Rif

Abstract

This report provides an exhaustive account of the Emirate of Nekor, an early autonomous Islamic state in the Rif region of modern-day Morocco. Based on a critical synthesis of fragmented and at times contradictory medieval sources, it reconstructs the chronological history of the Banu Salih dynasty and its successors. Beyond a simple list of rulers, this analysis delves into the complex interplay of Arab and Berber identity, the Emirate's geopolitical positioning as a crossroads of trade and conflict, and the enduring legacy of its unique hybrid governance structure. The report addresses key historical puzzles, including the discrepancies in the Emirate’s founding narratives and dissolution dates, offering a nuanced perspective on its rise, resilience, and ultimate fall.

Chapter 1: The Genesis of an Autonomous State in the Maghreb

1.1 The Geopolitical Landscape of the 8th Century Maghreb

The historical narrative of the Emirate of Nekor begins in the context of the Muslim conquest of North Africa, a process that commenced in 648 CE and brought Islam as the predominant religion to the region.1 Initially, the Maghreb was administered as a subsidiary province of the Islamic Empire, with its local governors appointed from Qayrawān in Ifriqiya.2 However, this central authority was frequently challenged due to the perception of mistreatment of the indigenous Berber (Amazigh) populations, who were subjected to heavy taxation and sometimes used as front-line soldiers in military campaigns.2 This simmering discontent culminated in the great Berber Revolt of 740 CE, which effectively broke the Maghreb away from the centralized control of the Umayyad Caliphate.2 The aftermath of the revolt did not lead to a single unified Berber state but rather fragmented the region into a collection of small, independent polities. The Emirate of Nekor emerged as a key example of this new political order, establishing itself as the first autonomous state in the Maghreb and a pioneer of statehood in the western half of the region, preceding the more famous Idrisid dynasty by over half a century.1

1.2 The Foundational Narrative of Şālih I ibn Mansūr (710–749 CE)

The Emirate of Nekor was founded in 710 CE by Şālih ibn Mansūr through a caliphal grant from the Umayyad Caliphate, with specific sources naming the caliph as al-Walīd I.1 This grant positioned the newly-formed state as a client of the Umayyads, an arrangement that would define much of its early history.1 The origin of the founder himself is a subject of scholarly debate, reflecting the complex blend of cultures that defined the emirate. While the ruling dynasty presented itself as of Himyarite Arab descent from Yemen, a claim that connected them to the prestigious Arab conquerors and provided a powerful source of legitimacy in the newly-Islamicized region, other historical accounts offer a different perspective.1 The Arab chronicler al-Ya'ķūbi, for instance, associates Şālih ibn Mansūr with the indigenous Nafzī Berber tribe.1 This contradiction is not a simple factual error but points to a strategic political reality. The Banu Salih family deliberately intermarried with the local Berber population, and the state became "predominantly Berber".1 The claim of a Himyarite Arab lineage provided external prestige, while a functional Berber origin, or at least a deep integration with the local populace, provided the internal legitimacy necessary to govern. This fundamental tension between a claimed Arab identity and a functional Berber reality is a core theme that runs through the Emirate's entire history.

1.3 The Initial Arab-Berber Dynamic and the First Succession Crisis

Under the guidance of Şālih ibn Mansūr, the local Berber tribes, including the Ghumāra and Şanhādja, were converted to Islam.1 However, this conversion was not a smooth process. The newly converted tribes reportedly "grew weary of the restrictions" of the new religion and, in an act of defiance, deposed Şālih, replacing him with a Berber leader named Dāwūd al-Rundī from the Nafza tribe.1 Şālih was later reappointed to the throne, which suggests that the interim leadership may have failed to provide the stability or legitimacy the tribes desired.1 This initial cycle of revolt and restoration is deeply revealing. It demonstrates that the Emirate's foundation was precarious and its authority was directly contingent on the consent of the local Berber tribes. The Islamization process was not a one-off event but a continuous negotiation between the ruling dynasty and its subjects. Upon his death in 749 CE, Şālih ibn Mansūr was succeeded by his son, al-Mu'taşim.1 The Emirate's early history established a pattern of internal volatility that would continue to challenge the dynasty for the remainder of its existence.

Chapter 2: A Chronicle of Emirs and a Fragmented Timeline

2.1 The Challenge of Historical Reconstruction

The reconstruction of the Emirate of Nekor's history is a significant challenge due to the scarcity and fragmented nature of medieval sources. Key historical texts, such as the main Wikipedia entry on the Emirate, provide a list of rulers with only a few specific dates, leaving large gaps in the timeline.1 In contrast, other documents provide a more extensive, though still often undated or questionably dated, list of successive emirs.12 This fragmented record is not merely a data gap but is a powerful indicator of the Emirate's political reality. As a small, peripheral state, Nekor lacked the centralized record-keeping of larger caliphates, and its history was primarily captured through external accounts or local tradition. The frequent internal conflicts and external pressures likely prevented long, stable reigns and systematic documentation, making the timeline itself a testament to the state's turbulent history.

2.2 The First Şālihid Rulers and the Founding of Nekor City

Following the reign of the founder, the succession continued through the Banu Salih family. Şālih I ibn Mansūr was succeeded by his son, al-Mu'taşim ibn Şālih.1 The most notable successor in the early period was Şālih's grandson, Sa'id ibn Idris ibn Şālih ibn Mansūr, who is credited with a pivotal decision for the emirate's future: the founding of a new capital city. In 760 or 761 CE, he established the city of Nekor, relocating the capital from the initial settlement of Tamsāmān.1 This strategic move from the coastal city to a more inland location, 25 kilometers from the Mediterranean, signaled a desire for a more defensible capital. Sa'id ibn Idris reigned for thirty-seven years, after which his son, Şālih ibn Sa'id, took power.1 Şālih ibn Sa'id's reign, which lasted for twenty-eight years, was marked by severe internal strife, including wars and conflicts with his brothers; he is reported to have imprisoned and executed his brother Idris.1

2.3 Dynastic Turmoil and External Pressures

The internal conflicts continued with the election of Şālih ibn Sa'id's youngest son, Sa'id ibn Şālih, to the emirate upon his father's death.1 In addition to internal challenges, the emirate faced significant external threats. In 859 CE, a long-distance Viking expedition, after being repelled from Spain, entered the Mediterranean and launched a major raid on Nekor.1 The Viking fleet, reportedly 62 ships strong, defeated a local force and plundered the city, taking many inhabitants as slaves.12 Some of these captives were later ransomed by the Umayyad Caliph at Córdoba.12 This event demonstrates that the Emirate of Nekor, despite its small size, was not an isolated entity but was deeply integrated into the wider Mediterranean world. The Viking raid highlights its vulnerability as a coastal state and confirms its strategic importance to the larger Islamic powers, whose involvement in ransoming captives further solidifies the vassal relationship.

2.4 The Shadow of Great Powers and the Fragmented Middle Period

The Emirate’s history is defined by its constant struggle for survival against the larger regional powers, particularly the rivalry between the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba and the Fatimid Caliphate of Ifriqiya. Nekor was repeatedly sacked by Fatimid forces in 917 and 934 CE, forcing the Banu Salih rulers to shift their allegiance and pay tribute to either caliphate as circumstances demanded.1 The Umayyads, concerned about Fatimid influence near al-Andalus, provided military support, including a naval assault to counter Fatimid incursions.1 The Emirate's survival in this environment was a function of its strategic ability to play one great power against the other. The rulers of this turbulent middle period are difficult to chronicle with certainty, but sources provide a fragmented list of successive emirs: Sa'id ibn Idris (d. c. 803 CE) 1 Şālih ibn Sa'id (d. c. 831 CE) 1 Sa'id ibn Şālih (Dates unknown) 1 Idris I ibn Salih Sa'id I ibn Idris (803–864) (Likely a duplicate or clerical error) 12 Salih II ibn Sa'id Sa'id I ibn Salih (917–927) 12 Salih III ibn Sa'id (927–929) 12 Abd al-Badi' ibn Salih "elMu'ayyid" (c. 930–935) 12 Abu Ayyub Isma'il ibn 'Abd al Malik (c. 936–940) 12 Musa ibn Rumi (940–947) 12 Jurthum ibn Ahmad (947–970) 1 Ya'la ibn al-Fatuh (c. 1015\) 1 The specific gaps in this list and the occasional contradiction are a direct result of the political instability that plagued the Emirate. The reliance on strategic alliances and the mountainous geography for defense allowed the state to endure, but its frequent dynastic conflicts and external pressures made it difficult to maintain a stable, well-documented line of succession.

Chapter 3: The Geographical and Economic Foundations

3.1 The Territorial Scope and Strategic Location

The Emirate of Nekor was centered in the Rif region of modern-day Morocco and controlled a territory that included productive agricultural land extending to the coastal plain near modern-day al-Hoceima.1 The Emirate's initial capital was Tamsāmān, but it was moved to the more strategic, inland city of Nekor in 760 or 761 CE by Emir Sa'id ibn Idris.1 This shift, which occurred early in the Emirate's history, suggests a deliberate strategy to protect the capital from the maritime threats that were prevalent in the Mediterranean at the time. The foresight of this move proved crucial, as subsequent Viking and Fatimid incursions often targeted the coast, and the more defensible, mountainous geography of the region provided a natural defense that helped the state maintain its independence despite numerous threats.15

3.2 A Crossroads of Commerce

The Emirate of Nekor flourished as a center for trade and commerce, leveraging its strategic location to become a vital economic and cultural hub.1 Nekor city served as a key entrepôt, facilitating commerce between Europe, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa.1 The Emirate's wealth was derived from its position on established trade routes, including the lucrative trans-Saharan trade network, where goods such as gold, slaves, and salt were exchanged.15 The coastal communities and ports in the Rif, including Badia, Buquya, and Bālish, were controlled by local Berber tribes who paid taxes to the emirs through income from maritime activities and the exploitation of marine resources.1 However, this prosperity was a double-edged sword. The Emirate's wealth made it an attractive target for external forces, from Viking raiders in the 9th century to the regional superpowers of the 10th and 11th centuries. This economic strength, while bolstering the Emirate's regional influence, also made it a critical battleground for the larger geopolitical conflicts of the medieval Islamic world. The dependence on these trade routes meant that any disruption, whether from raids or the rise of new trade networks, could fatally weaken the state's financial and political stability.

Chapter 4: Society, Culture, and Governance

4.1 Governance and Administrative Practices

The Emirate of Nekor's political structure was a unique synthesis of Islamic principles and traditional Berber governance.15 The ruling Banu Salih dynasty, with its claimed Arab descent, governed in a delicate balance of power with local Berber tribal leaders and Islamic scholars (ulama).15 This hybrid model was not accidental; it was a pragmatic and necessary approach to maintaining authority in a society where the ruling family was a minority. The Banu Salih family secured their position not by brute force alone but by integrating into the local social fabric through intermarriage with the Berber population.1 This provided a source of local legitimacy that supplemented the external legitimization provided by their relationship with the Umayyad Caliphate. This sophisticated model of governance, which included the taxation of local tribes for the income from maritime trade, was a key factor in the Emirate's remarkable longevity as a small state in a tumultuous region.1

4.2 Cultural and Religious Contributions

The Emirate of Nekor played a crucial role in the cultural and religious development of the region. Arab chroniclers consistently credit Şālih ibn Mansūr and the Banu Salih dynasty with the Islamization of the Rif.1 This was a foundational and lasting legacy that established a new religious identity for the local Berber populations. The Emirate's adherence to Sunni Islam, and specifically the Maliki school of jurisprudence, was a key theological point that cemented its alliance with the Umayyad Caliphate of al-Andalus, which also followed the Maliki creed.1 At its height, the city of Nekor was described in conflicting yet complementary terms as being both the "greatest center of Arabic culture" and the "greatest center of Berber culture" in the Rif region.13 This apparent contradiction provides a significant understanding of the Emirate's identity. Nekor was a cultural melting pot where the Arab-Islamic traditions of the ruling elite were fused with the indigenous Berber customs and traditions. This fusion created a syncretic cultural identity that was simultaneously and proudly Arab (by virtue of its written language and religious laws) and Berber (by virtue of its population, customs, and geographical location). This unique cultural blend is a primary legacy of the Emirate and provides valuable insights into the formation of a broader Moroccan identity.

Chapter 5: Dissolution and Enduring Legacy

5.1 The Fall of the Dynasty and the City

The end of the Emirate of Nekor is marked by two distinct and crucial events that are often confused in historical accounts. The first was the political dissolution of the founding dynasty. The Banu Salih's rule over the emirate ended around 1015 CE when Ya'la ibn al-Fatuh of the Azdaja tribe gained control, effectively ending the dynastic line but not the state itself.1 The second, and more definitive, event was the physical and territorial collapse of the state. The city of Nekor was destroyed for the final time in 1080 or 1081 CE by the Almoravid leader Yūsuf ibn Tāshfīn during his conquest of the Rif.1 This act brought a final end to the fief of Nakur, which was subsequently integrated into the expanding dominions of the Almoravids.1 This distinction between the end of the Banu Salih dynasty (c. 1015\) and the final destruction of the city (1080) is essential for a precise historical understanding of the Emirate's decline.

5.2 An Enduring Historical Footprint

Though the Emirate of Nekor faded from political significance with the rise of larger, more powerful states, its legacy endures as a pivotal chapter in Moroccan history. It holds a unique position as the first autonomous Islamic state in the Maghreb, pioneering a model of statehood that would be replicated and refined by later dynasties.1 The Emirate's most lasting contributions were its role in the spread of Sunni Islam among the Berber peoples of the Rif and its establishment of a hybrid governance and cultural model. The fusion of Arab and Berber cultures and the balance of power between a ruling family, tribal leaders, and religious scholars left a "lasting imprint on the history of the Maghreb".15 Later Islamic states, such as the Almoravids and Almohads, would draw on the governance and military strategies developed by Nekor.15 The story of the Emirate of Nekor, therefore, offers a crucial case study in the formation of early Islamic states in North Africa and the complex blending of Arab and Berber identities, highlighting the region's historical importance as a crossroads of trade, politics, and religion.

# **The Islamic Conquest of the Western Maghrib: A Narrative from Arabic and Islamic Sources**

### **Introduction: The Historiography of the Maghribi Conquest**

The history of the Islamic conquest of the Maghrib is a narrative deeply rooted in classical Arabic and Islamic sources, a body of work that presents a unique perspective distinct from modern Western historical accounts. A critical examination of these sources reveals that they are not mere chronicles of events but rather constructed narratives shaped by the intellectual and political contexts of the periods in which they were written.1 Understanding this historiographical framework is essential to interpreting the events of the conquest and its long-term legacy.

The earliest surviving accounts were composed in the 9th century, over two hundred years after the first military expeditions.2 Among the most foundational of these texts is the

*Kitāb Futūḥ al-Buldān* ("Book of the Conquest of the Countries/Lands") by Ahmad ibn Yahya al-Baladhuri (d. 892 CE). This work is a digest of a larger, now-lost history of the Caliphate, compiled by al-Baladhuri who traveled extensively in northern Syria and Mesopotamia to collect traditions.3 The value of his work as a primary source is widely acknowledged, but its accounts have been subject to criticism for a perceived lack of accuracy in detailing events.4 The specific focus of the

*Futūḥ al-Buldān* on the administrative policies and legal precedents of the conquests suggests that the historical narrative was being codified to serve the needs of the 9th-century Abbasid state.5 Another pivotal text from this era is the

*Futūḥ Miṣr wa'l-Maghrib* by Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam (d. 871 CE).6 It stands as the earliest surviving account of the conquests of Egypt, North Africa, and Spain 7, offering a wealth of information, some of which is unique to this chronicle.8 However, its purpose was primarily to document history for the benefit of Maliki law, and some of the traditions it contains are considered ahistorical or derived from sources known to be unreliable.2

Centuries later, beginning in the 12th century, a new and more detailed version of the conquest history was constructed at Kairouan, a narrative later expanded upon and finalized by scholars such as Ibn Idhari and Ibn Khaldun.1 Ibn Idhari al-Marrakushi (d. after 1312 CE) authored

*Al-Bayān al-Mughrib*, a key history of the Maghreb and Al-Andalus.10 His work is particularly valuable for its preservation of excerpts from older, now-lost chronicles, making it an invaluable resource for modern researchers.11 However, these later works, while rich in detail, are also noted for containing "conflicting accounts of events" when compared to earlier versions.2

The most distinguished of these later historians is Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406 CE), a polymath from Tunis who is considered a true historian with a critical sense, setting him apart from his predecessors who acted more as chroniclers and annalists.1 His monumental work,

*Al-Ibar* ("Lessons"), provides not only factual material but also a reasoned, philosophical interpretation of the history of the Berbers.1 His famous theory posits that dynasties rise from a vital, nomadic stage and inevitably decline into corruption and weakness as they become sedentary, a framework he applied to the history of North Africa.12

The significant time lag between the events of the 7th century and their first written records in the 9th century means the historical accounts are a process of retroactive construction. This process was influenced by the legal and administrative needs of the ruling Caliphates, which sought to legitimize their rule through a codified historical narrative. The absence of a Berber perspective in the written records further highlights this point, presenting the conquest and subsequent resistance as an Arab-Muslim narrative in which the local peoples are protagonists of either conversion or defeat, but not of their own independently recorded history.1

| Historian | Time Period | Key Work(s) | Noteworthy Contribution/Focus | Historiographical Context |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam | 9th Century CE | *Futūḥ Miṣr wa'l-Maghrib* | Earliest surviving account of the conquest; vast quantity of traditions | Written for Maliki law; can be ahistorical |
| Al-Baladhuri | 9th Century CE | *Futūḥ al-Buldān* | Key primary source on early Islamic history; digest of a larger work | Focus on administrative and legal aspects of conquest |
| Ibn Idhari | 14th Century CE | *Al-Bayān al-Mughrib* | Preserves excerpts from older, lost works; history of Maghreb and Al-Andalus | Later, more detailed narrative that can conflict with earlier accounts |
| Ibn Khaldun | 14th Century CE | *Al-Ibar* | Pioneering critical historian; provides a reasoned interpretation of Berber history | Analytical framework on dynastic rise and fall |

### **Part I: The Early Campaigns and the First Berber Resistance (c. 647–705 CE)**

The Islamic conquest of the Maghrib was not a singular event but a century-long, multi-phase process that began with raids and evolved into a determined effort at permanent occupation.2 The first Arab military expeditions into North African regions west of Egypt were launched as early as 647 CE, led by Abdallah ibn Sa'd.2 An army of 20,000 from Medina marched into Byzantine Africa and took Tripolitania, in modern Libya. The invading forces defeated Count Gregory, the local Byzantine governor who had declared his independence, at the Battle of Sufetula.2 However, this campaign, which lasted only fifteen months, concluded with the Arab army's withdrawal after they received tribute from Gregory's successor.2 This initial foray demonstrated the Arabs' military strength but also their strategic emphasis on profitable raids and temporary incursions rather than permanent control.

The second major phase of the conquest commenced in 665 CE under the Umayyad Caliphate, marking a shift toward permanent settlement and rule.2 A force of 10,000 Muslims, led by the renowned Arab general 'Uqba ibn Nafi' (d. 683 CE), marched from Damascus into North Africa.2 A key strategic move in this campaign was the founding of the city of Kairouan in 670 CE.2 'Uqba established Kairouan as a permanent military base and the new capital of the province of Ifriqiya, a decision that cemented a long-term strategy for governance in the region.14

'Uqba's most famous military exploit was his legendary march across Algeria and northern Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean.2 According to Islamic tradition, he plunged into the country's heart, traversed the wilderness, and reached the Atlantic coast near Agadir.18 He is famously quoted as saying, "Lord God, bear witness were I not stopped by the sea I would conquer more lands for Thy sake\!".18 In his advance, he besieged the coastal city of Tangier, though he was unable to fully occupy it.2 He was reportedly advised by the ruler of Tangier, Julian, to withdraw, who warned him of the Berbers being a "large, scattered army".16 This campaign, while celebrated in Arab sources as a heroic feat, highlighted the immense difficulty of establishing firm control over the western Maghrib, an area with a strong and independent population.

This campaign of direct Arab rule provoked a fierce backlash. On his return to Kairouan, 'Uqba's forces were ambushed near Biskra (in present-day Algeria) by a Berber-Byzantine coalition.2 'Uqba and his troops were killed in the battle, and the Arabs were temporarily expelled from their newly conquered territories.2 The leader of this coalition was the Berber king Kusayla ibn Lamzam, a chieftain of the Awraba tribe.15 Kusayla had previously converted to Islam but rebelled against 'Uqba's oppressive policies, a decision that led some early Arab writers to malign him for assassinating the Muslim emir.15 Kusayla's subsequent reign, centered from Tlemcen near the modern Moroccan border, represented a temporary Berber reassertion of power, but it was short-lived.15 He was later defeated and killed at the Battle of Mams by an Arab army led by Zuhayr ibn Qays, which reoccupied Kairouan.15

Following the death of Kusayla, a final and iconic resistance leader emerged: the legendary Dihya, or al-Kahina ("the Priestess").15 A formidable female warrior, she commanded the Jawara Berbers from the Aurès Mountains and famously defeated the Arab army led by Hasan ibn al-Nu'man.15 According to sources, she employed a "scorched-earth policy," ordering her followers to destroy crops and livestock in an effort to deter the Arabs, a tactic that ultimately alienated her own people.21 Despite her initial victories, she was eventually defeated and killed by Hasan's larger army in a battle that took place between 698 and 702 CE.15

The battles of Kusayla and Dihya al-Kahina were not merely setbacks for the Arabs; they were defining moments in the history of the Maghrib. The initial Arab conquest proved to be a protracted, multi-generational struggle with significant reversals of fortune, not a linear, triumphant march. The tenacious resistance led by these indigenous heroes demonstrates that the Maghrib was not a passive territory to be subdued but a region with a deep-seated tradition of political authority and a fierce sense of autonomy. The narratives surrounding their struggles became powerful symbols of resistance against external forces, foreshadowing how the indigenous population would later use the very ideology of their conquerors to assert their own identity.

### **Part II: The Consolidation of Rule and the Berber Response (c. 705–1050 CE)**

The final phase of the Islamic conquest of the Maghrib was led by Musa ibn Nusayr, who was appointed governor of Ifriqiya in 698 CE, officially completing the conquest by 709 CE.2 His appointment marked a new administrative approach, as he was the first governor of Ifriqiya not to be subordinate to the governor of Egypt, signifying a more direct and permanent commitment to the region by the Umayyad Caliphate in Damascus.15 Musa's campaigns were highly successful; he annexed the entirety of North Africa as far as Tangier, a city he was the first Muslim general to take and occupy.24 His forces also conquered the Sous region, effectively bringing the whole of northern Morocco under Umayyad control.24

A key element of Musa's success was his strategy of military and political integration. He managed to convince large numbers of Berbers to convert to Islam and join his army as soldiers and officers, including the future conqueror of the Iberian Peninsula, Tariq ibn Ziyad.15 This Berber participation was crucial, as the subsequent conquest of Spain (Al-Andalus) in 711 CE was carried out by an army that was composed of both Berbers and Arabs.15

The conquest had a profound and lasting cultural impact on the Maghrib. Over the next several centuries, the region became largely Islamized and partially Arabized, a process that proved more durable than the influence of previous conquerors.15 However, the spread of Islam among the Berbers did not translate into unquestioning loyalty to the Umayyad rulers. The Umayyad administration frequently betrayed the Islamic ideal of equality among all believers. They treated Berber converts as second-class citizens, giving them less pay than Arab warriors and taking them as slaves, particularly women.15 This contradiction between the professed equality of Islam and the reality of Umayyad ethnic prejudice fostered deep resentment among the Berbers.

This resentment found a powerful ideological expression in Kharijite Islam, a sect that rejected the ethnic basis of Umayyad rule and asserted that any qualified Muslim, regardless of race or lineage, could be elected as a caliph.15 The egalitarian tenets of Kharijism resonated deeply with the marginalized Berber population, providing a religious justification for political rebellion against the Arab ruling class.15 This simmering discontent erupted into the major Berber Revolt of 740 CE, a massive uprising that effectively ended Umayyad control over the Maghrib.15

Following the revolt, the Maghrib entered a long period of political fragmentation, characterized by the rise of numerous independent, indigenous Berber states.15 Kharijite kingdoms, such as the Rustamid Imamate of Tahert (761–909 CE) in what is now western Algeria, and the Banu Midrar in Sijilmasa, in southern Morocco, flourished by controlling major trans-Saharan trade routes.15 These states became centers of scholarship and Islamic learning, demonstrating that the Maghrib was no longer a periphery under Eastern rule but an independent region with its own distinct political and intellectual life.23 This period of dynastic fragmentation represented a powerful reassertion of Maghribi identity, no longer simply reacting to foreign invasion but actively constructing its own form of an Islamic state, a direct outcome of the social and political contradictions of the conquest era.

### **Part III: The Indigenous Imperial Project: The Almoravids and Almohads**

The political fragmentation of the Maghrib, which followed the Berber Revolt of 740 CE, was eventually arrested by the rise of a new wave of indigenous Berber dynasties, the most powerful of which were the Almoravids and Almohads. These empires represent the culmination of the processes set in motion by the initial Arab conquest, demonstrating how the Berber peoples absorbed and repurposed the new Islamic ideology to forge their own powerful imperial projects.29

The Almoravid dynasty (*al-Murābiṭūn*, meaning "inmates of a fortified monastery") emerged from the Sanhajah Berber tribes of the Sahara in the mid-11th century.27 Their movement was founded by the religious scholar 'Abd Allah ibn Yasin, who used a militant Islamic revival as a means to unify the tribes and provide a powerful justification for their conquests.15 The Almoravids adhered strictly to the Maliki school of law, which provided the religious legitimacy for their authority.32 From their Saharan base, they conquered the western Maghrib, taking control of key cities like Sijilmasa by 1056\.15 Their military successes were immense, and under their commander Yusuf ibn Tashufin, they went on to conquer most of Muslim Spain by 1110 CE, establishing a vast empire that stretched from the Sahara to the Iberian Peninsula.15 They established their capital in Marrakech, which they built from the ground up, transforming it into a major cultural and economic hub.15

A century later, the Almoravids were challenged and eventually replaced by a rival Berber dynasty, the Almohads (*al-Muwaḥḥidūn*, meaning "those who affirm the unity of God").30 This movement was founded by Ibn Tumart, a member of the Masmuda Berber tribes from the High Atlas mountains, who preached a reformist message in opposition to what he considered the moral laxity of the Almoravids and their legalistic interpretation of Islam.33 The core principle of Almohad ideology was a radical unitarianism (

*tawhid*), which rejected any independent attributes of God as polytheistic.33 Ibn Tumart, who declared himself the Mahdi, organized his followers into a powerful, disciplined force that waged a revolutionary war against the Almoravid state.36

The Almohads ultimately defeated the Almoravids, establishing a vast and centralized empire that would dominate the Maghrib and Al-Andalus for over a century.12 The ascendancy of these two dynasties is a crucial period in the history of the Maghrib, as it represents the full flowering of an indigenous imperial project. The Almoravids and Almohads were not simply extensions of Arab rule; they were new, Berber-led empires that used the framework of Islam to unify the region and assert their own political and cultural dominance.30 The ideological and theological conflicts between them—the Maliki legalism of the Almoravids versus the unitarian reformism of the Almohads—were not just power struggles; they were profound disputes over the very nature of an Islamic state. This dynamic demonstrates that by the 11th and 12th centuries, the Maghrib had become a major center of Islamic thought, capable of producing and exporting its own reformist movements that could challenge and replace existing dynasties.

| Dynasty Name | Founding Date | Founder | Core Ideology | Capital City | Maximum Extent |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Almoravids | c. 1040 CE | 'Abd Allah ibn Yasin | Strict Maliki school of law | Marrakech | Western Maghrib and Al-Andalus |
| Almohads | c. 1121 CE | Ibn Tumart | Strict unitarianism (*tawhid*) | Marrakech, Seville, Rabat | Maghrib (to modern Libya) and Al-Andalus |
| Saadians | c. 1509 CE | Abu Abdallah al-Qaim | Sharifian (descent from Prophet) | Marrakech | Western Maghrib, control of Trans-Saharan trade routes to Gao |

### **Part IV: The Saadian Sultanate: A New Age of Sharifian Authority (c. 1509–1659 CE)**

The final stage of this historical narrative is marked by the rise of the Saadian Sultanate in the 16th century, a dynasty that emerged in a new geopolitical context dominated by internal decline and external threats from Portugal and Spain.37 The Saadians, a Sharifian family, rose to power by leading a religious opposition movement against the ruling Wattasid dynasty.37 Their claim to religious legitimacy through descent from the Prophet Muhammad resonated with the population, and by 1554 CE, they had toppled the Wattasids and reunited the country.37

The Saadian's military prowess was solidified by their decisive victory over the Portuguese at the pivotal Battle of Alcácer Quibir in 1578\.34 This victory was a major turning point, as it not only solidified their control over Morocco but also established them as a formidable power in North Africa, effectively deterring further European encroachment on their territory.34 With their borders secured, the Saadian Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur turned his attention southward.

In 1591, Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur launched a famous military expedition across the Sahara to conquer the Songhai Empire.37 The Saadian army, though smaller, was equipped with firearms, giving them a decisive advantage over the Songhai forces at the Battle of Tondibi.38 The victory allowed the Saadians to occupy the Songhai capital of Gao and effectively gain control of the trans-Saharan trade routes, which secured their supply of gold and slaves.37 The conquest of the Songhai Empire reveals a profound shift in the motivations of Maghribi imperial policy. The official reason for the invasion was a religious one—the Songhai's refusal to acknowledge the Saadians as caliphs.39 However, a deeper analysis of the situation shows that the true motivations were both economic and geopolitical. European trade routes along the coast had begun to undermine the traditional trans-Saharan caravans, reducing the flow of gold into Morocco.39 With a powerful military machine and no strong enemies to the north (the Ottoman and Spanish empires were too formidable), the Saadians needed a new outlet for their military and a new source of wealth. The push southward was a logical, pragmatic response to this economic reality, demonstrating a sophisticated form of statecraft that seamlessly blended religious legitimacy with geopolitical necessity.

### **Conclusion: The Enduring Narrative of the Maghrib**

The historical trajectory of the Maghrib, as documented in classical Islamic sources, is far from a simple narrative of foreign conquest and passive assimilation. It is a complex, cyclical story of a region that was repeatedly conquered but never fully subdued in its identity. The early Arab-Muslim campaigns, though a military and religious introduction, were met with tenacious and at times successful indigenous resistance. The administrative shortcomings of the Umayyad rulers then ironically transformed the introduced religion into an ideological tool for rebellion, leading to the rise of independent Berber states.

The later Almoravid and Almohad dynasties represent the culmination of this process, demonstrating the full maturity of an indigenous, religiously-inspired imperial project. These empires were a testament to the fact that the Berbers were not merely subjects but active agents of their own history, capable of taking a new religious framework and using it to unify their people and build powerful states that would shape the political and cultural landscape of the wider Islamic world. The final phase, marked by the Saadian Sultanate, showed how this indigenous tradition could assert itself on a global stage, balancing religious claims with the pragmatism of economic and political realities. The enduring legacy of the Islamic conquest of the western Maghrib is therefore not a monolithic Arab-Islamic identity, but a deeply nuanced tapestry woven from early Arab influence and resilient Berber heritage, a testament to the powerful synthesis of external force and internal identity.

I'll search for comprehensive information about the Nekor Kingdom rulers, including Arabic sources.Based on my extensive research, including Arabic sources, I can now provide you with a comprehensive list of the rulers of the Nekor Kingdom.

### **Nekor (or Nakkur), Emirate of Banu Salih**

**Nekor**, also called **Lankur** or **the Emirate of Banu Salih**, was a historical state ruled by the **Salihid dynasty**, established in **710 CE** by **Salih ibn Mansur** in **Temsaman**, in the Rif region of northern Morocco.  
 It was the **first independent emirate in Morocco** following the Berber revolt against Umayyad governors. Unlike other early Moroccan states such as **Banu Midrar** and **Barghawata**, which followed Kharijite sects, Nekor adopted **Sunni Malikism** from the start.

Temsaman remained the ruling base until **Sa‘id ibn Idris** built the city of **Nekor** between the Nekor and Ghis rivers, about five miles from the coast. In **865 CE (244 AH)**, during his reign, Nekor was attacked for a week by **Norman Vikings**.

The Emirate expanded until it bordered the **Miknasa** state. The geographer **al-Bakri** described Nekor’s territory as stretching over ten days’ journey.

Its geographic location placed it amid constant struggle between **the Umayyads of al-Andalus (Sunnis)** and **the Fatimids of Ifriqiya (Shi‘ites)**. The Fatimid general **Masala ibn Habus** seized it in **929 CE (308 AH)** during his war against the Andalusian Umayyads.

Although Nekor resisted the Fatimids, the **Umayyads of al-Andalus**, pursuing their own political interests, allied with **Musa ibn Abi al-‘Afiyya**, leader of the Miknasa Emirate, who entered Nekor in **940 CE (319 AH)** under Umayyad authority.

Nekor remained caught in this **Umayyad–Fatimid conflict** until **1094 CE (473 AH)**, when it was destroyed by **Almoravid** forces led by **Yusuf ibn Tashfin**.

---

### **Geography**

Nekor lay about **26 km from Al Hoceima**, believed today to be submerged under the **Abdelkrim al-Khattabi Dam**. It was originally called **Marsa Musa**, where **Musa ibn Nusayr** had landed.

The Rif region, in the north of Morocco, had belonged administratively to **the province of Tangier** before Islam, and this arrangement continued under the **Umayyad Caliphate**. The first Muslim contact with the governor of Tangier, **Ilyan**, occurred during **Uqba ibn Nafi‘s second campaign (62 AH)**, resulting in peace and truce — meaning that **Nekor was never conquered by force** during the Islamic expansion.

The **capital** was the historic city of **Nekor**, followed by towns such as **Melilla, Temsaman, and Badis**, and ports like **Kart** and **Hark**.

Parliament members from Al Hoceima have demanded the return of archaeological finds discovered during the construction of the Abdelkrim al-Khattabi Dam, which were moved to national museums in the 1980s.

Four tombs of Nekor’s fifteen rulers still exist in the Rif.

* **Salih ibn Mansur’s** shrine lies in **Temsaman**, next to that of his son **al-Mu‘tasim**, who ruled briefly.

* **Prince Idris**’s tomb is in **Sidi Idris village**, said to have been looted by treasure hunters.

* Outside Sidi Idris lies the grave of **Sa‘id ibn Idris ibn Salih**, on the roadside.

### **Foundation**

After the Islamic conquest of Morocco, **Salih ibn Mansur** — among the first converts and students of law in **Kairouan** — was sent west by **Hassan ibn al-Nu‘man al-Ghassani**, commander under the Umayyad Caliph **Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan**, to integrate the **Rif region** (home to the **Nafza** tribes) into Islam.

He was the first to enter central Rif at **Temsaman**, known as “the Righteous Servant.”

While most historians like **Ibn Khaldun** and **Ibn al-Khatib** claim Salih was of **Yemeni Arab descent**, the historian **al-Ya‘qubi** reported a local version, saying:

“They claim he was of the people of the country, a Nafzawi,”  
 which he heard from Nekor’s inhabitants during his visit in **278 AH**.

The tribes of Temsaman and neighbors followed Salih and made him ruler, and the **Umayyad Caliph al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik** formally recognized his rule in **91 AH**.

**Al-Bakri** narrates:

«وعلى يديه أسلم بربرها وهم صنهاجة وغمارة، ثم ارتد أكثرهم لما ثقلت عليهم شرائع الإسلام وقدموا على أنفسهم رجلا يسمى داود ويعرف بالرندي... وأخرجوا صالحا من البلد ثم تلافاهم الله بهداه وتابوا من شركهم... واستردوا صالحا».

After a brief apostasy, the tribes repented and reinstated Salih as their ruler. He remained until his death in **132 AH**, buried by the sea near today’s village **Iqtī**, around the fall of the Umayyads and the rise of the Abbasids.

The Emirate relied on the **Nafza** tribal confederation — notably **Banu Waryaghel** and **Banu Yuslitin** (now **Temsaman**).

Following **Andalusian famine in 745 CE**, several **Andalusian families** migrated to Nekor, particularly the **Androsan** clan, who settled in **Ajdir** (in Nekor) and integrated into the Amazigh Rifian society. Over time, they **became fully Berberized**.

### **Building the City of Nekor**

Under **Sa‘id ibn Idris**, Islam flourished; he **founded the city of Nekor**, built a **mosque on the Ghis River** patterned after the **Alexandria Mosque**, and established a **ribāṭ (frontier monastery)**.

In **859 CE**, **Vikings** with **62 ships** attacked Nekor for **eight days**, plundering it before returning to al-Andalus.

---

### **Relations with the Idrisids**

When the **Idrisid movement** reached northern Morocco, tribes like **Miknasa** and **Ghomara** joined Idris I, while Nekor maintained independence but offered refuge to Idrisid exiles.  
 **Ahmad ibn Idris II** even married **Umm al-Sa‘d bint Salih**, the sister of Emir Sa‘id, and lived in Nekor until his death.

---

### **Fatimid Campaigns**

When **Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi** rose in Ifriqiya, he sent letters inviting Nekor to obey him, writing also to **Sa‘id ibn Salih**, then governor of Nekor. At the bottom of his letter, he composed:

فإن تستقيموا أستقم لصلاحكم  
 وإن تعدلوا عني أرى قتلكم عدلاً  
 وأعلو بسيفي قاهراً لسيوفكم  
 وأدخلها عفواً وأملؤها عدلاً

Sa‘id ordered a poet named **al-Akhmash**, from Toledo, to reply:

كذبت، وبيت الله، لا تحسن العدلا  
 ولا علم الرحمن من قولك الفصلا  
 وما أنت إلا جاهل ومنافق  
 تمثل للجهال في السنة المثلى  
 وهمتنا العليا لدين محمد  
 وقد جعل الرحمن همتك السفلى

In **304 AH (916 CE)**, al-Mahdi ordered his general **Masala ibn Habus** to attack Nekor. He captured it and killed **Sa‘id ibn Salih** after fierce resistance. Many of Sa‘id’s descendants fled to al-Andalus, and Nekor was devastated.

Masala ruled Nekor for six months, then appointed **Dalul of the Kutama tribe** as governor (916–917 CE). But **Banu Sa‘id**, led by **Idris al-Mu‘tasim** and **Salih al-Yateem** from Málaga, returned and overthrew Dalul — **crucifying him and his men on both banks of the Nekor River**. Salih sent a victory letter to **Caliph Abd al-Rahman III**, read publicly in Córdoba’s Great Mosque.

The Fatimids attacked again in **935 CE (323 AH)** under **Sandal al-Fatā**, who killed **Abu Ayyub Ismail**, the prince of Nekor.

---

### **Control of Córdoba**

**Miknasa tribes**, under **Musa ibn Abi al-‘Afiyya**, invaded Nekor in **940 CE (319 AH)**, killing its ruler **Abd al-Badi‘ ibn Salih** and devastating the city.

**Ibn Hawqal**, visiting later, described Nekor’s ruins.

After **Abd al-Rahman al-Nasir** declared himself Caliph in Córdoba, he coordinated another campaign with Musa, bringing Nekor fully under Umayyad control.  
 They installed **Abd al-Samī‘ ibn Jurthum** as a nominal ruler without real power.

In **326 AH**, after Musa’s death, the people revolted and killed Abd al-Samī‘. They then **invited Jurthum ibn Ahmad ibn Ziyadat Allah** from Málaga and made him Emir. He ruled **25 years (948–971 CE)**, rebuilding the city and restoring prosperity under Malikism.

Later, **Berber Azdaja tribes** seized Nekor, but the **Almoravids** under **Yusuf ibn Tashfin** launched a massive campaign in **1094 CE**, completely destroying the city and ending the emirate.

---

### **Economy**

Nekor’s economy thrived on agriculture along the **Nekor and Ghis rivers**, using advanced irrigation. It became a **granary of the Rif**, and its ports — especially **Temsaman** and **al-Mazamma** — served as **major trade hubs** linking Morocco and al-Andalus.

Al-Mazamma port was famous for hosting **forty ships and 3,000 men** of the Andalusian fleet sent by Caliph Abd al-Rahman al-Nasir.  
 It remained a vital Mediterranean trade port until the 10th century, connecting directly to **Málaga**, **Bajjana**, and **Almería**.

---

### **Culture**

Nekor adopted the **Maliki school** from its inception, making it **the first center of Malikism in Morocco**.  
 According to al-Bakri, the Emirs of Nekor **led prayers and delivered Friday sermons themselves**, combining political and religious authority.

The city’s **Great Mosque**, modeled after Alexandria’s, produced many scholars such as:

* **Ibrahim ibn Ayyub al-Nakkuri**

* **Musa ibn Yasin** (mathematician)

* **Husayn ibn Fath**, grammarian and poet

Artists from Nekor were invited to Córdoba by **Caliph Abd al-Rahman III**, including **al-Nakkuri the flutist**, whom **Ibn Hazm** mentions in *Ṭawq al-Ḥamāmah*:

«فلعهدي بعرس في بعض الشوارع بقربطة ، والنكوري الزامر قاعد في وسط الحفل ... وكان فيما مضى يزمر لعبد الرحمن الناصر...»

Poet **Ibrahim ibn Ayyub** wrote:

أيا أملي الذي أبغي وسولي  
 ودنياي التي أرجو وديني  
 أأحرم من يمينك ري نفسي  
 ورزق الخلق من تلك اليمين  
 ويحجب عن جبينك طرف لحظي  
 ونور الأرض من تلك الجبين  
 وقد جبت المهامه من نكور  
 إليك بكل ناحية أمون

According to historian **Ahmed al-Tahiri**, author of *“The Emirate of Banu Salih in Nekor”*:

“What later flourished in al-Andalus during the 4th–5th centuries AH in all fields of knowledge owes much to the intellectual foundations first laid in Nekor.”

---

### **Rulers of the Emirate of Nekor**

**Banu Salih in Temsaman:**

* Salih ibn Mansur — 710–750 CE

* al-Mu‘tasim ibn Salih — 750 CE

* Idris ibn Salih — 750–760 CE

**Banu Salih in Nekor:**

The foundation of Nekor, referred to in the sources as the Emirate of Nekor (Amara an-Nekor), marks a significant early development in the political history of the Maghreb. This state was established in the **northern Rif** region of Morocco.

The sources detail the founder's identity, the political circumstances of the founding, and the high-level imperial support received:

### **The Founder and Identity**

The founder of the Emirate of Nekor was **Salih ibn Mansur**. His true identity, however, is subject to conflicting narratives.

* **Claimed Identity:** Many established historical accounts, including the book of Ibn Khaldun, assert that Salih ibn Mansur was of **Himyarite Yemeni descent**. The princes of Nekor, known as Banu Salih, actively advanced this claim of Mashriqi (Eastern) lineage for political reasons. This was a widespread trend (*moda*) among Amazigh tribes in the Middle Ages. Claiming Arab lineage provided stability and durability to their political system, placing the leadership above the tribal and communal rivalries that were prevalent in the second half of the third century AH.  
* **Local Identity:** The earliest accounts, recorded by the historian Al-Ya'qubi in his *Kitab al-Buldan*, who traveled widely and personally visited the Emirate of Nekor in the third century AH, state that Salih ibn Mansur was a **Nafzi from the local people** (*نفذي من اهل البلد*). The inhabitants of the country confirmed this identity to Al-Ya'qubi. Salih ibn Mansur was from Banu Slaytan, who were inhabitants of Jabal Abi al-Hasan, specifically the Tamsaman بطن.

### **The Founding Event**

Salih ibn Mansur was originally a Muslim who traveled to Ifriqiya (North Africa, east of Morocco) to learn the teachings of Islam.

1. **Religious Mission:** He returned to the land of Nafza to spread Islam among its tribes during the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. He was initially sent to the Rif by Hassan ibn al-Nu'man al-Ghassani, the governor of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in Ifriqiya, to "open" the Maghreb (between 69 and 79 AH).  
2. **Shift to Politics:** After the death of Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in 86 AH, Salih ibn Mansur shifted his goal from religious proselytization to a **political call** (*الدعوه السياسيه*), deciding suddenly to establish an emirate for himself in Nekor.  
3. **Imperial Sanction:** When the successor Caliph, **Al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik**, was informed that Salih ibn Mansur intended to found an Islamic emirate, he approved the idea and **granted it to him** in the years 91 AH. This event occurred just one year before the conquest of Al-Andalus.

### **Geopolitical Support and Strategy**

The establishment of Nekor received unusual protection and support from the Umayyad Caliphate, despite the importance of their governor in Ifriqiya, Musa ibn Nusayr.

* Caliph Al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik issued instructions to Musa ibn Nusayr that he was **not to interfere** with Salih ibn Mansur's Emirate of Nekor, but instead should proceed to the far west of the Maghreb. This policy of non-interference might have also extended to the emirate of Julian al-Ghumari.  
* The decision to support a Nafzi Berber in establishing an emirate and shielding him from a major governor like Musa ibn Nusayr was influenced by **Tariq ibn Ziyad**.  
* Tariq ibn Ziyad al-Yiznasni al-Hasi an-Nafzi, who was from the same region and people as Salih ibn Mansur, was planning the **conquest of Al-Andalus**. Tariq supported Salih ibn Mansur in founding the Emirate in Nekor to **pave the way** and ensure the cooperation of the Nafza and Ghomara tribes, who were considered the tribes most knowledgeable about the Iberian Peninsula, for the invasion.

In summary, the sources suggest that the foundation of Nekor was not just a local uprising but a **strategically sanctioned act** by the Umayyad Caliphate, influenced by Tariq ibn Ziyad, designed to consolidate regional power among loyal local Berber leaders (like Salih ibn Mansur) one year before the launch of the decisive conquest of Spain.

The sources provide extensive material for the analysis of religious beliefs in Morocco, covering the foundational doctrines that shaped dynastic legitimacy, the dominant schools of law and spirituality, the role of religious figures in political resistance, and the complex nature of local and contested faiths.

## **I. Religious Legitimacy and Dynastic Foundations**

Religious belief, particularly adherence to Islamic principles and descent from the Prophet Muhammad, was the fundamental source of political legitimacy for Moroccan dynasties across centuries:

* **Sharifian Legitimacy:** The **Idrisid dynasty** (788–974) marked the birth of the first autonomous Islamic state in Morocco, established by **Idris ibn Abdallah**, a *Sharifian* (descendant of the Prophet). This set a powerful political model, later successfully revived by the Saadian and Alaouite dynasties, making Sharifian lineage a cornerstone of authority.  
* ***Jihad*** **as a Mandate for Rule:** The **Saadian dynasty** (1510–1659) based their rise to power on a dual claim: their Sharifian lineage and their leadership of the ***jihad*** (holy war) against the Portuguese occupiers. Their decisive victory at Agadir in 1541 cemented their legitimacy as **national heroes and true defenders of Islam** in the eyes of the populace, in contrast to the Wattasids, who were seen as failing in their religious duty to protect the realm.  
* **Theological Reform and Zeal:** Earlier Berber empires were also rooted in religious ideologies. The **Almoravid** movement (1040–1147) began as a puritanical religious reform movement established in a *ribat* (fortified religious retreat). The **Almohads** (1121–1269) were founded by **Ibn Tumart**, who declared himself the ***Mahdi*** and preached a radical doctrine of absolute divine unity (*Tawhid*).

## **II. Dominant Islamic Schools and Institutions**

In the 16th century, religious life was deeply structured by established schools of jurisprudence and highly influential Sufi organizations:

* **Maliki Fiqh:** Morocco was predominantly **Sunni Muslim**, adhering to the **Maliki rite**. The Maliki school of law was the **official and dominant** school throughout the Maghreb. Foundational texts of this school, such as Malik ibn Anas's ***al-Muwaṭṭaʾ***, were widely studied.  
* **Sufism and Marabouts:** Sufism was deeply embedded in Moroccan society, providing a spiritual framework and social cohesion. **Marabouts** (holy men) and *shurafa* held immense spiritual influence due to their perceived possession of ***baraka*** (blessing) and *karāmāt* (supernatural powers). Sufi brotherhoods, or **Zawaya**, served as dynamic centers of devotion, learning, and **popular mobilization** against foreign occupation, particularly when the central government (the Wattasids) proved ineffective.  
* **Theological and Devotional Texts:** Libraries contained core religious texts, including the foundational sacred text of the ***al-Qurʾān al-Karīm***. Other staples included the revered biography of the Prophet, ***al-Shifāʾ bi-taʿrīf ḥuqūq al-Muṣṭafá*** by Qadi 'Iyad, and the popular devotional prayer book focusing on blessings upon the Prophet, ***Dalāʾil al-Khayrāt*** by al-Jazuli.

## **III. Contested and Local Belief Systems**

The analysis of religious belief also reveals areas of fierce controversy and the influence of localized, non-formal traditions:

* **The Barghawata Dispute:** The political and ideological rivals of the **Barghawata Confederacy** (which controlled the central Atlantic coast) claimed the state was based on apostasy and heresy (*al-Kufr wa-al-Zandaqa*). Earlier narratives asserted they followed a new religion and their kings claimed prophecy. However, detailed analysis suggests Barghawata was actually on the **Kharijite Safri** denomination. This Mâdhhab (school) rejected the condition that the ruler must be from the Quraysh tribe. Historical accounts describe the Barghawata as having deep respect for the Qur'an and following tenets of Islam, but their political independence and adherence to the strict, puritanical Safri school led opponents to spread rumors of apostasy.  
* **Aniconism in Art:** Islamic **aniconism**—the avoidance of representing living beings—was a core principle of Saadian art, particularly in religious contexts. Elite architecture, such as the Saadian Tombs, avoided animal or human depictions, focusing instead on abstract, complex geometric patterns (*zellij*) and carved stucco (*muqarnas*). However, this rule was relaxed in the **secular sphere**; Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur commissioned a fountain featuring sculpted figures of a **lion and leopards** for his palace, Dar al-Hana, in part to visually claim the legacy of the Andalusian caliphs, such as the Court of the Lions in the Alhambra.  
* **Folklore and Resistance:** Popular beliefs included various superstitions. Most significantly, the female mythological figure **Aicha Kandicha** (a *jinn* often associated with water sources and seduction), is linked to a compelling local narrative of **resistance against the Portuguese occupation** near Mazagan. The theory posits that a historical woman from El Jadida (Mazagan) seduced Portuguese soldiers who were then ambushed and killed by Moroccan fighters, transforming Kandicha into a powerful, defiant female archetype against colonialism.

In essence, the analysis of religious belief in Morocco reveals that spiritual authority, expressed through Sharifian lineage and adherence to Islam (often Maliki, infused with Sufi practices), was the **central political currency**, capable of unifying the state and mobilizing military opposition to foreign powers. This framework was flexible enough to accommodate both extreme puritanical movements and rich local traditions and folklore.

The religious beliefs of the Barghawata Confederacy, which controlled the central Atlantic coast of Morocco, are the subject of conflicting historical narratives, but detailed analysis suggests they adhered to a specific Islamic denomination.

The most thorough interpretation of their beliefs concludes that the Barghawata were **Muslims** who followed the **Kharijite Safri** denomination.

### **The Disputed Claims: Apostasy and Heresy**

Many later historical accounts, primarily associated with the geographers **Ibn Hawqal and Al-Bakri**, claimed that the Barghawata state was based on **apostasy and heresy** (*al-Kufr wa-al-Zandaqa*).

These narratives asserted that the Barghawata had founded a **new religion** and that their kings claimed prophecy. These accounts, however, are questioned for several reasons:

1. **Silence of Contemporaries:** Earlier historians and geographers who traveled widely in the Maghreb and were contemporaries of the Barghawata state, such as Al-Ya'qubi (who visited Morocco in the third century AH), Al-Idrisi, Ibn Abd al-Hakam, and Al-Maqdisi, **never mentioned** the existence of a new Barghawata religion or claims of apostasy. This silence is considered significant, as such claims would be too serious to omit.  
2. **Contradictions and Feasibility:** The stories told by Ibn Hawqal and Al-Bakri contained contradictions regarding who founded the religion. Furthermore, the claim that the religion remained hidden for approximately a century (as suggested by Al-Bakri's narrative) is considered "unreasonable" (*ghayr ma'qul*) in the history of faiths.  
3. **Lack of Doctrinal Conflict:** The historical confrontations between the Barghawata and the Idrisids were primarily political, waged **"for the purpose of unifying Morocco,"** and were **not based on doctrinal differences**.

### **The Safri Kharijite Conclusion**

The analysis suggests that the belief that the Barghawata were apostates was a false rumor spread by their enemies to discredit them, likely stemming from their opposition to mainstream Islamic politics.

The truth, supported by detailed analysis, is that the Barghawata were **free Amazigh Muslims** (*Muslimin min al-Saffriyyah al-Khawarij*) who were strict in their beliefs and followed the doctrines of the Kharijite Safri school.

This adherence had profound political implications: the Safri school **rejected the condition that the ruler must be from the Quraysh tribe**. This allowed their local Berber leadership to assert political independence and reject the authority of Arab-Sharifian dynasties like the Idrisids and the Umayyads, though they did maintain complex relationships of **friendship and respect** with the Umayyads of Córdoba.

### **Barghawata Practices and Piety**

The Barghawata were characterized by intense piety and a stringent approach to worship:

* **Asceticism:** They were described as adherents of **piety and asceticism** (*al-taqallul wa-al-zuhd*).  
* **Respect for Islam:** They **did not deny the prophecy of Muhammad**, confirming that he was truthful in the *Qur'an* and its rulings. Sources confirm that people among the Barghawata read the Qur'an with "utmost respect".  
* **Prayer:** They were notably stricter in their ritual practices than Maliki Sunnis, observing **five prayers during the day and five prayers during the night**.  
* **Strictness and Punishment:** Their strictness extended to law and punishment, where they would **kill a thief** rather than merely amputate his hand.

The rumors that their leaders claimed prophecy likely arose because the Barghawata engaged in local divination (*kahanah*), studied astrology (*'ilm al-nujum*), and philosophy (dialectic/ *kalam*), leading local, less-educated people to mistakenly view them as prophets.

In summary, the most reliable conclusion is that the Barghawata were **devout, strict, independent Muslims** of the Kharijite Safri school, and the accounts describing them as heretics or apostates were politically motivated exaggerations used by their dynastic and ideological rivals.

Thank you for this nuanced and well-argued exposition. Your synthesis offers a compelling revisionist perspective on the Barghawata Confederacy that challenges the dominant narrative found in sources like \*\*Al-Bakri\*\* and \*\*Ibn Hawqal\*\*. Below is a structured summary that captures the core argument and evidence:

\---

\#\#\# \*\*Revised Understanding of Barghawata Religious Identity\*\*

\#\#\#\# \*\*Traditional Narrative (Questioned)\*\*  
\- \*\*Claim\*\*: The Barghawata founded a \*\*heretical new religion\*\*; their kings (starting with \*\*Ṣāliḥ ibn Ṭarīf\*\*) claimed prophecy; they abandoned Islam.  
\- \*\*Sources\*\*: Primarily \*\*Al-Bakri\*\* (11th c.) and \*\*Ibn Hawqal\*\* (10th c.), writing centuries after the confederacy’s founding.  
\- \*\*Alleged Practices\*\*: A unique scripture in Berber, altered rituals, and rejection of Muḥammad’s finality.

\#\#\#\# \*\*Critical Reassessment (Your Argument)\*\*  
The "heresy" narrative is likely a \*\*polemical distortion\*\* by political and religious opponents. Instead, the Barghawata were \*\*orthodox within their own Islamic framework\*\*—specifically, the \*\*Sufriyya branch of Kharijism\*\*.

\#\#\#\#\# \*\*Key Evidence for the Sufri Kharijite Identity\*\*  
1\. \*\*Silence of Earlier Authorities\*\*    
   Contemporary or near-contemporary historians—\*\*Al-Ya‘qubi\*\* (visited Morocco in 278 AH / 891 CE), \*\*Al-Idrisi\*\*, \*\*Ibn ‘Abd al-Ḥakam\*\*, and \*\*Al-Maqdisi\*\*—\*\*never mention\*\* Barghawata apostasy. Such a grave accusation would be unlikely to go unrecorded if true.

2\. \*\*Political, Not Doctrinal, Conflicts\*\*    
   Struggles with the \*\*Idrisids\*\* were about \*\*territorial control and unification of Morocco\*\*, not theological disputes—suggesting shared (or at least compatible) religious foundations.

3\. \*\*Kharijite Safri Doctrine Aligns with Barghawata Practice\*\*    
   \- \*\*Rejection of Qurayshi Caliphate\*\*: The Sufri Kharijites believed leadership should go to the most pious Muslim, \*\*regardless of tribe\*\*—enabling Berber self-rule.  
   \- \*\*Strict Asceticism and Piety\*\*: The Barghawata’s reported rigor in prayer (10 daily prayers), harsh penalties (death for theft), and ascetic lifestyle mirror known Kharijite tendencies.  
   \- \*\*Affirmation of Muḥammad’s Prophethood\*\*: They \*\*did not deny Islam\*\*; rather, they upheld the Qur’an with “utmost respect.”

4\. \*\*Origin of the “Prophecy” Myth\*\*    
   Barghawata elites’ engagement in \*\*astrology\*\*, \*\*divination\*\* (\*kahanah\*), and \*\*dialectical theology\*\* (\*kalām\*) may have been misinterpreted by outsiders as claims of new prophecy—a common medieval polemical trope against heterodox groups.

5\. \*\*Diplomatic Relations\*\*    
   Their \*\*cordial ties with the Umayyads of Córdoba\*\* (a Sunni power) further undermine the idea of complete religious apostasy; such alliances would be improbable with a non-Muslim entity.

\---

\#\#\# \*\*Conclusion\*\*  
The Barghawata Confederacy was not a pagan or syncretic breakaway cult, but a \*\*politically independent, rigorously pious Berber-Muslim polity\*\* grounded in \*\*Sufri Kharijite Islam\*\*. Their "heresy" was primarily \*\*political\*\*: the assertion that Berbers could rule themselves without Arab or Sharifian legitimacy. The sensationalized accounts of Al-Bakri and Ibn Hawqal likely reflect \*\*Sunni orthodoxy’s marginalization of Kharijite sects\*\* and the \*\*propaganda of rival dynasties\*\* seeking to delegitimize a resilient, autonomous Amazigh state.

This reinterpretation restores the Barghawata to their rightful place within the diverse tapestry of early Islamic thought in North Africa—not as apostates, but as \*\*independent Muslim reformers\*\*.

Based on the historical records available, the names of Jurthum ibn Ahmad's sons are not specified. The provided sources detail the broader family tree of the Banu Salih dynasty but do not list his direct descendants.

\#\#\# 👑 The Documented Family Tree of the Banu Salih

The most detailed genealogical information comes from a family tree of the Salihid Emirs. It shows that Jurthum ibn Ahmad was the son of a man named Ahmad ibn Zidayat Allah, and he had at least one known cousin, Musa ibn Rumi, who also briefly ruled as emir. This tree clearly illustrates Jurthum's place within the wider dynasty but does not extend to show his children.

| Relationship | Figure | Notes |  
| :--- | :--- | :--- |  
| \*\*Grandfather\*\* | Zidayat Allah ibn Sa'id | Part of the ruling line |  
| \*\*Father\*\* | Ahmad ibn Zidayat Allah | Not listed as an emir |  
| \*\*Ruler (Cousin)\*\* | Musa ibn Rumi (r. 936-940) | Grandson of Abd al-Sami' ibn Salih |  
| \*\*Ruler\*\* | \*\*Jurthum ibn Ahmad (r. 947-970)\*\* | The last well-documented emir of the dynasty |

\#\#\# 🔍 How to Look for More Clues

Tracing specific medieval genealogies can be challenging. If you wish to continue this research, here are a few suggestions:

\*   \*\*Consult Primary Chronicles\*\*: The most promising leads would be in medieval Arabic chronicles. The works of historians like \*\*Ibn Khaldun\*\* and \*\*al-Bakri\*\* are directly cited as sources for this period and might contain more nuanced details not included in modern summaries.  
\*   \*\*Refine Your Search\*\*: Try searching specifically in Arabic for phrases like "بنو صالح" (Banu Salih) or "ابناء جرثوم بن أحمد" (the sons of Jurthum ibn Ahmad). Primary sources, when available, are often not fully translated and remain in their original language.  
\*   \*\*Manage Expectations\*\*: Be prepared that this information may be lost to history. For many lesser-known dynasties, the historical record is fragmentary, and the names of non-ruling descendants were often not systematically recorded.

I hope this helps clarify the available information for your research. Would you like me to help search for the titles of the historical books written by Ibn Khaldun or al-Bakri that mention the Emirate of Nekor?

Battle of Sebou  
Berber Revolt  
(740)  
tamsna

Perfect — that’s the one that really *cracks the empire*. It’s basically the Maghrebi version of “the peasants storm the Death Star,” only with Zenata cavalry, Kharijite zeal, and sandstorms instead of TIE fighters.

Let’s break it down cleanly for **The Great Berber Revolt (c. 740–743 CE)** — with everything you need for historical fidelity, game-level design, and character/narrative depth.

---

## **🗺️ I. Historical Context**

**Period:** 740 – 743 CE  
 **Main Region:** Western Maghreb (modern Morocco & western Algeria)  
 **Main Opponent:** Umayyad Caliphate (governors of Ifriqiya & al-Andalus)  
 **Spark:**

* Berbers, recently Islamized, were treated as second-class Muslims.

* The Umayyad governor **ʿUbayd Allah ibn al-Ḥabḥāb** imposed **the jizya (non-Muslim tax)** on them, seized lands, and enslaved captives even when they were Muslims.

* Berber tribes finally snapped — uniting under tribal and religious banners (mostly **Sufrite Kharijites**) demanding equality under Islam and freedom from Arab domination.

---

## **⚔️ II. Timeline & Major Phases**

| Year | Key Event | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **739 CE (late)** | Growing unrest in Tangier & Sous (Morocco) | ʿUbayd Allah’s officials overtax Berbers; local preachers spread Sufrite ideology of equality. |
| **740 CE (early)** | **Maysara al-Matghari** proclaimed leader in Tangier | Commoner (possibly water-carrier or shepherd). Symbol of social rebellion; name means “the victorious one.” |
| **740 CE (mid)** | Maysara leads attacks on Umayyad garrisons | Tangier and surrounding forts fall. Rapid spread west to Fes & Rif region. |
| **740 CE (late)** | Maysara executed by his own commanders | He was seen as too lenient or incompetent; replaced by **Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati**, a seasoned Zenata commander. |
| **741 CE** | **Battle of the Nobles (Maʿrakat al-Ashrāf)** | Near Tangier or Wadi Chelif. Berber victory; most Arab noble cavalry killed. |
| **741 CE (late)** | **Syrian army** dispatched by Caliph Hisham ibn ʿAbd al-Malik\*\* | 30,000 elite troops under **Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qushayri** with **Balj ibn Bishr** leading advance guard; joined by 40,000 local Arabs in Ifriqiya. |
| **742 CE (early)** | **Battle of Bagdoura (near Sebou River, Fes region)** | Decisive Berber victory. Khalid ibn Hamid annihilates the Syrian-Ifriqiyan army; commanders killed. Survivors flee north to Ceuta. |
| **742 CE (mid)** | Syrian survivors cross to al-Andalus | They bring the chaos into Spain, sparking Arab factional wars there. |
| **742–743 CE** | **Battle of al-Asnam (near Chlef)** | Umayyads regroup under **Handhala ibn Safwan** (new governor of Ifriqiya). He crushes remaining Berber armies (\~300,000 claimed) and retakes Kairouan. |
| **743 CE (late)** | Revolt collapses in Ifriqiya | The rebellion fractures into tribal sects. Western Maghreb effectively breaks off from Umayyad control — paving the way for independent Berber dynasties. |

## **🧑‍✈️ III. Main Leaders & Factions**

### **🔸 Berber Rebels**

| Leader | Tribe / Role | Ideology / Traits |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Maysara al-Matghari** | Matghara tribe | Charismatic populist; started the revolt. Possibly executed by his peers. |
| **Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati** | Zenata confederation | Skilled general; led at Bagdoura; rallied diverse tribes. |
| **ʿAbd al-Wāḥid ibn Yazīd al-Hawwari** | Hawwara tribes | Later Sufrite preacher-leader in eastern Maghreb. |
| **ʿUqasha ibn Ayyūb al-Fazari** | (Arab Kharijite) ally | Acted as ideological mentor for some Berber units. |

**Estimated strength:**  
 At the revolt’s height, chroniclers cite **100,000 – 200,000 Berber fighters**, though actual organized troops were probably closer to 40–60 thousand.  
 For game logic: you can design the early revolt as **small guerrilla skirmishes (1–2k troops)** and escalate to **mass tribal coalitions (50k+)** by Bagdoura.

---

### **🔸 Umayyad Caliphate**

| Commander | Region / Force | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **ʿUbayd Allah ibn al-Habhab** | Governor of Ifriqiya | Oppressive policies triggered revolt. |
| **Khalid ibn Abi Habib al-Fihri** | Local Arab noble | Killed at Battle of the Nobles (740). |
| **Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qushayri** | Syrian commander | Sent by Caliph; killed at Bagdoura (741). |
| **Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri** | Syrian advance guard; later enters al-Andalus | Survived Bagdoura; led Syrian remnants into Iberia. |
| **Handhala ibn Safwan al-Kalbi** | Appointed 742 to Ifriqiya | Reasserted control at al-Asnam; decisive in ending revolt in east. |

**Estimated strength:**

* Ifriqiyan regulars: 30–40 k

* Syrian reinforcements: 30 k (elite, heavily armored)

* Arab tribal militias in Andalus and Tunisia: 10–20 k  
   → Total potential: \~80–90 k

## **⚔️ IV. Major Battles — Detailed Breakdown**

### **1\. Battle of the Nobles (740 CE)**

* **Location:** Near Wadi Chelif or Tangier (sources differ)

* **Forces:**

  * Berbers: \~20–40 k

  * Umayyads: \~10–15 k Arab nobles under Khalid ibn Abi Habib

* **Outcome:**

  * Umayyad elite cavalry wiped out; entire Arab aristocracy of the Maghreb decimated.

  * Berber morale skyrocketed; rebellion spread like wildfire.

---

### **2\. Battle of Bagdoura (741 CE)**

* **Location:** Near Sebou River, close to modern Fes.

* **Forces:**

  * Berbers: 100–200 k (many lightly armed tribal levies)

  * Umayyads: 70 k (30 k Syrians \+ 40 k locals)

* **Outcome:**

  * Total Umayyad defeat; Kulthum ibn Iyad and most officers killed.

  * Remaining 10–12 k Syrians flee to Ceuta, then to al-Andalus.

  * Result: Umayyad rule west of Ifriqiya collapses completely.

* **Tactical Note:** Berbers used **ambush tactics**, **river traps**, and **guerrilla flanking** on unfamiliar terrain — textbook asymmetric victory.

---

### **3\. Battle of al-Asnam (742 CE)**

* **Location:** Near modern Chlef (Algeria).

* **Forces:**

  * Berbers: “300 k” claimed (likely 60–80 k).

  * Umayyads: 10–12 k elite troops under Handhala ibn Safwan.

* **Outcome:**

  * Decisive Umayyad victory; Berbers massacred; revolt contained east of the Maghreb.

  * Marked the **end of the Great Revolt** as a unified movement.

---

## **🏴‍☠️ V. Consequences**

1. **Collapse of Umayyad authority in the western Maghreb** — Morocco effectively becomes independent.

2. Rise of new **Berber Islamic states**:

   * **Barghawata Confederation** (Atlantic plains, 744 CE)

   * **Midrarid (Sijilmasa)** and later **Rustamid (Tahert)** dynasties.

3. **Power vacuum** in al-Andalus: Syrian troops bring their internal feuds, triggering civil wars.

4. **Birth of Amazigh Islamic identity** — equality, piety, and autonomy over Arab tribal hierarchy.

## **🧭 VI. Locations for Map / Level Design**

| Region | Key Sites | Visual/Environmental Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Tangier–Fes Corridor** | Tangier, Sebou River, Bagdoura plains | Lush valleys, river crossings, pre-Islamic ruins. Ideal for open-field battles. |
| **Atlas Mountains & Rif** | Tribal homelands of Zenata & Matghara | Mountain ambushes, narrow passes, fortified villages. |
| **Ifriqiya (Tunisia/Algeria)** | Kairouan, Chlef (al-Asnam) | Arid steppe, desert campaigns; final large-scale battlefields. |
| **Ceuta & Strait Zone** | Refuge of Syrian survivors | Coastal fortress environments — perfect for naval/escape missions. |

---

## **🧠 VII. Ideological & Cultural Layer**

* **Religion:** Sufrite Kharijism – fiercely egalitarian, rejecting Arab superiority.

* **Tribal Ethos:** Honor, independence, alliance through necessity not hierarchy.

* **Moral Theme for storytelling:** “Faith without justice is tyranny.”

* **Visual cues:** Early Islamic banners (plain black/white cloth), Berber leather armor, oval shields, long javelins, simple swords.

* **Language texture:** Arabic-Berber mix — early Maghrebi Arabic, Zenata dialects, Qur’anic invocations blended with Amazigh idioms.

---

## **🎮 VIII. Adaptation Hooks (for *Omniversify*)**

* **Prologue Mission:** Tax revolt in Tangier – stealth infiltration of Umayyad fort.

* **Act I:** Rise of Maysara – recruit tribes, skirmish with tax collectors, siege Tangier.

* **Act II:** Betrayal & leadership shift – Khalid ibn Hamid takes command.

* **Act III:** Massive open-battle scenario – Battle of Bagdoura.

* **Act IV:** Epilogue in Ifriqiya – dwindling unity, final stand at al-Asnam.

* **Legacy cutscene:** Birth of Barghawata state, Berber scholars chanting “La hukm illa lillah” (“Judgment belongs only to God”) as torches light the mountains.

Would you like me to create a **full structured historical dossier** (with timeline chart, troop compositions, political map, and character profiles) for this revolt — formatted for integration into *Omniversify* lore or UE5 world-building documents?


Creating a comprehensive spreadsheet with **detailed, year-by-year chronologies of every ruler** for all 15 Moroccan states—alongside a full list of their internal and external battles—is an **enormous scholarly undertaking** that exceeds the scope of a single response. The primary reason is a **severe lack of reliable, continuous data**, especially for the early medieval period.

However, I can provide you with a **structured framework** for your spreadsheet, including **verified ruling periods for states with known dynastic lists**, and note where **data is incomplete or unknown**. I’ll also include key **liberation conflicts**, such as the Saadian campaigns against the Portuguese.

### Critical Notes:
- **Gaps Exist**: For early states (Nekor, Sijilmasa, Barghawata, Banu Ifran), **full lists of rulers with exact dates do not survive** in historical records.
- **"Liberation" Context**: Before the 15th century, conflicts were mostly **inter-tribal or dynastic**, not "national liberation." The **Saadian-Portuguese wars** (16th c.) are the clearest example of a campaign to **free Moroccan coastal cities from European occupation**.
- **Sources**: This framework draws on standard references like *The Cambridge History of Africa*, Ibn Khaldun’s *Muqaddimah*, Al-Bakri’s *Masalik*, and modern scholarship.

You can build your spreadsheet from this structure, and for states with incomplete ruler lists, you can mark cells as “Unknown” or “Fragmentary Records.” Let me know if you’d like help sourcing ruler lists for specific dynasties (e.g., full Marinid or Alawi lists).
