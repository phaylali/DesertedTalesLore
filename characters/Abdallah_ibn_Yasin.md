## Biography
Abdallah ibn Yasin was a Maliki theologian and the spiritual founder of the Almoravid movement, which unified North Africa and Islamic Spain. Born in Tamanart to the Jazulah tribe of the Sanhaja confederation, he studied under Waggag ibn Zallu al-Lamti in the ribat of Aglu near Tiznit.

In 1046, Yahya ibn Ibrahim, chief of the Gudala tribe, sought a teacher for the superficially Islamized Sanhaja Berbers. Waggag sent ibn Yasin, who preached orthodox Sunnism, forbidding pagan practices. Rejected initially, he retreated to the Sahara, gathering followers and forming a disciplined community.

Allied with Yahya ibn Umar of the Lamtuna tribe, ibn Yasin created the Almoravid alliance (al-Murabitun, "those bound to God"). They conquered Sijilmasa in 1054, enforcing strict Maliki doctrine, banning wine and music, abolishing non-Islamic taxes, and allocating war spoils to religious leaders.

After Yahya's death in 1056, ibn Yasin appointed Abu Bakr ibn Umar as military leader. He died in 1059 during an assault on the Barghawata near Rommani. His mausoleum in Krifla remains a pilgrimage site, symbolizing Almoravid puritan zeal.

## Skills and Abilities
Ibn Yasin excelled in theology, preaching, and organizational leadership. He instilled martial discipline and religious orthodoxy, transforming tribal societies into a unified Islamic force. His teachings emphasized jihad and Maliki law, laying the ideological foundation for the Almoravid empire.
