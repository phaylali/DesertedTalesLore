## Biography
Ibn Tumart was born in the village of Igiliz in the Sous valley of southern Morocco. He studied in Córdoba under al-Turtushi and traveled to Baghdad, where he was influenced by Ash'arite theology and Zahiri jurisprudence. Upon returning to the Maghreb, he preached a strict doctrine of tawhid (divine unity), criticizing the Almoravids for their laxity and anthropomorphism.

In 1121, he declared himself the Mahdi in a cave near Igiliz. He organized the Masmuda tribes and founded the fortified settlement of Tinmel in 1122 as the base for the Almohad rebellion against the Almoravids. His movement emphasized puritanical Islam, rejecting innovations and enforcing strict adherence to the Sunnah.

Ibn Tumart died in August 1130, shortly after the disastrous Battle of al-Buhayra. His disciple Abd al-Mu'min succeeded him and transformed the movement into a conquering empire.
