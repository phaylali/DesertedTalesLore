As a member of the Banū Sālih dynasty, he ruled until his death in 749 CE, with a brief interruption in 712 CE when local Berber tribes, finding Islamic restrictions too burdensome, deposed him and installed Dawud al-Rundi al-Nafzi. However, dissatisfaction with the new ruler led to Salih's reinstatement, allowing him to continue his reign for nearly four decades.
