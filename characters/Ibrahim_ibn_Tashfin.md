## Biography
Ibrahim ibn Tashfin was the young son of Tashfin ibn Ali. Upon his father's death in 1145, he was proclaimed emir at the age of about 14. His youth and inexperience led to instability, as his uncle Ishaq ibn Ali refused to recognize his rule, sparking internal conflict in Marrakesh amid the Almohad siege.

Ishaq briefly took over, but the Almohads, led by Abd al-Mu'min, captured Marrakesh in 1147. Both Ibrahim and Ishaq were killed in the ensuing massacre, ending the Almoravid dynasty and ushering in the Almohad Caliphate.

## Skills and Abilities
