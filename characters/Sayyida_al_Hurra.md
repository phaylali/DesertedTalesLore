## Biography
Sayyida al-Hurra, born Lalla Aisha bint Ali ibn Rashid al-Alami around 1491–1495 in Chefchaouen, Morocco, was a prominent 16th-century Moroccan ruler and privateer of Andalusian descent. Her family, including her father Ali ibn Rashid al-Alami, a Sharifian founder of Chefchaouen, and mother Lalla Zohra Fernandez from Vejer de la Frontera near Cadiz, fled Granada after the fall of the Emirate of Granada in 1492. She received an excellent education, fluent in Castilian Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic, and was taught by scholars like Abdallah al-Ghazwani.

Married at age 16 to Sidi al-Mandri II, governor of Tétouan, she became his de facto vice-governor, managing affairs during his absences. After his death in 1515, she assumed the title "al-Hurra" (the Free Woman) and governed Tétouan independently for over three decades until 1542. Her rule was marked by resistance against Portuguese and Spanish expansion, employing piracy, diplomacy, and alliances with the Ottomans, including Hayreddin Barbarossa, to protect northern Morocco and aid Andalusian refugees.

In 1541, she married Sultan Ahmed al-Wattasi of Fez, the only Moroccan king to wed outside the capital, refusing to leave Tétouan. This alliance strengthened her position, with her brother Moulay Ibrahim appointed vizier. She commanded a pirate fleet, dominating the western Mediterranean, negotiating with European powers for captives' release, and was feared as a "queen" by her enemies.

Overthrown in 1542 by her son-in-law Muhammad al-Hassan al-Mandri, she retired to Chefchaouen, dedicating her later years to religious work. She died around 1552–1562. Her legacy endures as a symbol of female leadership and resistance against colonialism, though often marginalized in patriarchal histories.

## Skills and Abilities
Sayyida al-Hurra excelled in governance, diplomacy, and naval warfare. As a privateer, she led pirate operations against Iberian powers, securing resources and captives. Her multilingual education and strategic alliances, including with the Ottomans, demonstrated exceptional political acumen. She balanced military prowess with administrative skills, fostering Tétouan's growth as a refuge for Andalusian exiles.
